            "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">Phoenix Athletics Club was formed in 1981 by Matt Paterson and Olympic champion Steve Ovett. They wanted to take a new approach to athletics, which at the time was radically different. The focus was to respect the individual&rsquo;s development and not be bound by old structures like leagues, the athletes choosing their own paths within what was clearly a performance-focused club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">This idea of &ldquo;inclusive excellence&rdquo; still drives the club, which has stuck to its core beliefs by respecting the personal ambitions and fulfilling the potential of each individual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">The club has also evolved.&nbsp; In the 1990s we broadened to become an athletics and triathlon club. Triathlon and other multisport events have a lot in common with the original values and ambition of the club.&nbsp; And while, just like in the 1980s, we still have world-class athletes, our members now span an age range of 9-79 and are just as happy testing themselves in local fun runs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">In 2012 the club amended its name to&nbsp;<strong>Brighton Phoenix&nbsp;</strong>to ensure potential members and competitors know who we are and where we come from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">As in 1981 we are open and welcoming: Steve Ovett did not stand on a pedestal and nor does anyone else.</p>",

We do this by placing each individual in a group according to their ability. Groups are run by one of our experienced and enthusiastic coaches, who give up their time to look after athletes free of charge. There are regular coaching meetings to improve training standards and to adjust the size of groups to keep them at manageable levels. The club&#39;s philosophy is to enjoy athletics while getting the most from your potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To this end coaches provide a wide variety of training sessions to stimulate the interest of our athletes. Competitions &ndash; ranging from events such as the London Marathon to the South Downs Way Relay &ndash; are available throughout the year, and coaches will give athletes every encouragement to enter.<br />\r\nClub night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brighton Phoenix is based at Withdean Stadium, where we meet every Wednesday, come rain or shine, throughout the year. This is the best time to come and meet coaches from the club as members of all five sections of the club will be training at some point during the evening. Training sessions for the juniors are from 5:30pm onwards according to age and ability; those for seniors are from 6:30pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will find details of additional sessions, such as our weekly long runs, Monday drills and hills sessions, Saturday-morning cycle rides or our coached swimming sessions on the training page.You can also keep updated by being put on the specific group email lists as training locations and sessions vary throughout the year, please see the <a href=\"/contact/\">contact page</a> for more information.</p>",

            "content": "<p><strong>Benefits of Membership</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">We aspire to be a welcoming, friendly and inclusive club. Most people who join Brighton Phoenix hope to learn more about their sport and step up their performance to achieve their potential while also making friends, being inspired and enjoying the camaraderie of being in a club.&nbsp; In a recent (2017) survey of members, the main reasons they gave for joining were training opportunities, athletic development, the reputation of the club and its friendliness.&nbsp;Competing is also important to members - over three quarters said they had competed in the last year, across a range of types of event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">Our coaching team have been competing and coaching for decades and through this comes a wealth of knowledge, learned first-hand; and these skills are passed down to up and coming coaches &ndash; many of who are members who first joined to compete and decided to get more involved. With the added opportunity to train and compete with other athletes of a similar or better ability, Brighton Phoenix all share their enjoyment for the sport, and tend to also get involved as volunteers helping to organise events and supporting their clubmates.&nbsp; Anyone who has watched any of the big Brighton road races will be aware of just how popular a local club Phoenix is!&nbsp; Clearly our members have a vast range of interests and abilities. Age groups, and those involved in different disciplines or who have similar goals tend to train together, and often arrange to go on training or competing trips to different parts of the country (and in some cases further afield). Giving our members as many opportunities to try something new has always been of high priority to us, because as important as tradition is in athletics you cannot be afraid to do something different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">While the club &ldquo;vibe&rdquo; is really what it is all about there are some useful financial benefits too. Club members are able to obtain a 10% discount at: RUN, Blatchington Road, Hove; Sweatshop, Queens Road, Brighton; and the Jog Shop, George Street, Kemptown, Brighton, and can often also get discounts on treatments and massages from other club members.&nbsp; Club members are automatically registered with England Athletics and as such they receive a discount on UKA race entry fees, and can choose to have their profile and results listed on the England Athletics Power of 10 and Run Britain websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">Membership includes free entry to Withdean Stadium on training nights (Wednesdays 5.30pm-8pm). For some other specialised training activities (Turbo, Strength and Conditioning, and Swimming) we ask for a small contribution towards the cost of renting the facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">For Members who reach required standards to compete in the British Milers Club (BMC) races, membership is paid for by Phoenix.&nbsp; Entry fees for Sussex Championship races are also paid by the club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">But perhaps the most important benefit of being a member is being able to compete for the club and wear our distinctive and iconic Phoenix vest. Steve Ovett became an Olympic gold medal winner and, although we can offer no guarantee that you will follow in his footsteps, we will support you in all your efforts to do so!</p>",

We offer training and racing opportunities to everyone from 9-79 (and beyond) in a spirit of friendship and mutual support. We are non-discriminatory and non-judgmental: we are about everyone being the best athlete they possibly can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">We believe in &lsquo;inclusive excellence&rsquo;. For us excellence is not measured in absolute performance but in the performance relative to someone&rsquo;s ability, effort and general commitment. We appreciate the limitations imposed by life/work/family balance, and the other demands and pressures we are all subject to. Within this context a 4-hour marathon for one athlete is a bigger achievement than a sub 3-hour marathon for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">We currently have around 400 members training and competing in running and multisport at local, regional, national and international levels, or just looking to get fit and stay healthy. We do encourage our members to race, but we never force them to: it&rsquo;s always a matter of personal choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">The club is managed and led by volunteers most of whom have many years&nbsp;experience in racing and training. Our coaches are UK Athletics and British Triathlon Federation qualified and our Board has specific legal, management and sport administration skills and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\">Welcome to your club, welcome to Brighton Phoenix!</p>",

            "content": "<p>We accept junior athletes from the age of nine upwards. New athletes are invited to try three sessions on our club night, which is Wednesday, before committing to joining. There may be a waiting list for juniors. Please email if you want to try a session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Training</strong><br />\r\nOur approach to training is based on the progressive long term development of the individual athlete. We take a long term view for the good of the child, both as an athlete and a person and therefore deliberately restrict training for the younger athletes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Training for 9 to 14 year olds is held at our club night at Withdean Stadium on Wednesday evenings at 5:30pm. Athletes are split into small groups based not only on their chronological age but also their biological age (physical and emotional) and training age (time training). At this age training is about learning how to train, having fun trying different activities and learning fundamental movement patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As athletes develop and show commitment and ability they will be invited to progress through groups and eventually start to specialise at events. Athletes are then invited to training groups at 6:30 on Wednesdays. Additional training is also held on Mondays, Saturdays and Sundays at different times and venues, due to limited coaching resources this is by invitation only based on ability and commitment. When athletes are considered ready specialist strength and conditioning sessions are also available at different times of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All sessions start with warm up and drills to prepare the body for the main training session. The younger groups are taught the warm up and drills that they will do as they progress to seniors, as the athletes get older they will be expected to warm up and drill by themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The club has a number of international athletes, many of whom have progressed through the club and the older junior training groups often have combined training sessions with these athletes, which can be very inspirational and educational for the junior athletes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Competing</strong><br />\r\nThe club believes that competing is important as it helps young athletes to develop both their athletic and life skills. The club therefore requests all junior members in the U13 age groups and older compete at least three times a year in both summer and winter events. Although we encourage our younger members to try competing in different events they will only be asked to compete in events they feel comfortable with and will never be pressured to compete in events just to gain points for the club. If an athlete does not want to compete they should speak to their coach/team manager/child welfare officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have athletes regularly competing in events around the region and nationally from the U11 age group upwards, with the emphasis on enjoyment and personal development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer the club enters local U13 and U15 track leagues, giving members the opportunity to compete as individuals in a team environment. Members also compete in open meetings and regional and national championships. See (link to info on summer training)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the winter the club competes in the Sussex x-country league as well as Sussex indoor sportshall league. Members also compete in regional and national x-country races as well as indoor athletic open and championship events. See (link to info on winter training)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A race list can be found in <a href=\"/fixtures/\">Fixtures</a>.</p>",

Many participants have come from a single-discipline sport, wishing to have more variation in training or looking to increase the challenge/enjoyment of competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no doubt that some people organise their lives around multisport, while others just want to have a go and see what the sport is all about. Brighton Phoenix can help you either way &ndash; we have nearly 30+ multisport athletes at all levels of competition, ranging from novices in their first season to seasoned international standard athletes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have just joined or wish to see what we are about, have a look around our site, come along to a few sessions and start to get into the multisport scene.</p>",
