What made this all the more remarkable was the solo nature of the run (second and third were a full three minutes behind). Phoenix now has an enviable record in the time trials with three athletes in the top 10 times. Josh is first, Matt Barrie is fifth and Dave Carter is ninth. In addition a glance at the age-group lists show Josh (25-29), Matt Barrie (15-19) and Andrew Haig (60-64) in first place with Flo Ray (20-24), Max Pickard (JM14), Dave Carter (30-34), Phil Hampshire (50-54) and Bob Novis (55-59) in second place. <a href=\"http://www.parkrun.org.uk/brighton/Results.aspx\">Full result</a></p>",

It gives us a qualification place for the National Championships on 17th October and the word is that the team are keen to take up the opportunity. <br /><br />The other Phoenix team on the day was the over 40 men's team. Twenty-first out of 39 completing teams is also an excellent result in this context, From start to finish our runners just got faster with newcomer Ray Mattews on third leg taking us from 28th to 21st and Gary Thayre holding that place with the fastest leg of 22:21. <br /><br />This year we were unable to field teams in the women's, juniors' and older vets' categories.<br /><br />The photos by Lance Bellers show Pat Davoren kicking off for the seniors and the over 40s in action. The team shot of the seniors was taken by a Brighton and Hove runner and is hence out of focus.</p>",

Sophie Coleman (2nd), Erica Martin (12th), Liz Durman (20th) and Anita Jones (46th) made up the women's A team. Katie KIdger, who has transferred to Phoenix, was 19th but is not yet eligible to score for us. Looks like she is going to be a great asset for the women's team.<br /><br />The junior age groups were represented thinly with no entries at all for U13 and U15 girls and complete teams only for U15 boys (silver team medal &ndash; William Dukin indiv) and U17 boys (bronze team medal &ndash; Charlie Grice indiv).

An hour and a half later Tim followed the mile up with a 1:51.77 victory in the 800m.</p>\r\n<p>On 30th Jan he also came 2nd over 800m at seattle with a 1:49.47. This race can be seen on Flotrack. Go to www.flotrack.org and type Tim Bayley into the search box.</p>\r\n<p>Tim is now officially Phoenix's 5th sub <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://phoenix.curve21.com/javascripts/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js?1251896290\"></script>4min miler behind Steve Ovett, Mark Rowland, Johan Boakes and Mark Howard.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile back in sunny Britain Dan Stepney has been getting himself back in form after missing the last two years of track racing due to injuries. He started the season with a 4:04.10 1500m in his heat at the Southern Indoors. On 30th Jan he came 5th in the London Indoor Games in 1:53.6 over 800m. On 6th/7th Feb Dan won the Birmingham Games 800m...winning his heat (1:55), his semi 1:54.8 ) and the final ( 1:55 ).</p>\r\n<p>Both Tim and Dan are heading up to the UK trials next weekend.</p>\r\n<p></p>",

He needed this race to prove his point having come second the week before at the British trials in a slow tactical time. This time there was no mistake. Although placing seventh in the race, He posted a substantial pb of 3:40:16 and that was enough to impress the selectors and give Phoenix its first representation at a major international championship since Pat Davoren ran in the Commonwealth Games. Tim becomes the club indoor 1500 metre record holder.<br /><br />You can watch live online <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/\">here</a> Heats on Fr<br /><br />Tim has also twice broken the 4 minute indoor Mile barrier before his departure from the states. His best of 3:59:53 was in Seattle on January 16. This makes him 5th on the club all-time list behind Steve Ovett, Mark Rowland, Johann Boakes and Mark Howard. Tim must surely be eyeing the 2012 Olympics as an achievable ambition.</p>",

Second claim member, Tom Naylor was, with Tim Hutchins, the event organiser &ndash; so hearty congratulations to him. Olympic Champion and club founder Steve Ovett started the race. Mike Whyte and Tim Woodman fulfilled their pacing roles to perfection and, of course, 30+ of you took part and came up with some quality performances. We had four runners under three hours led by returning member Neil Boniface (7th in 2:41:23). Mike Greenwood ran the best judged race of all finishing 18th in a time of 2:50:13 which shaves his previous best by some 25 minutes!. Good to see Daryl Hards back in shape and although he slipped back in the closing miles managed an impressive 2:54:36. Max-Patrick Lippert was supposed to be running the Boston Marathon but his plans fell to ash (of the Icelandic variety) but he was offered a last minute place in the race and responded with an even-paced 2:59:42 for 90th position. As you can see from the list here, a further 18 Phoenix athletes finished under four hours with everyone safely home by five. As if that weren't enough, Charlie Grice won the mini mile event. Last year Charlie broke Steve Ovett's 800m Brighton schoolboy record, taking it down to 1:55.80. On Sunday he got to meet the great man in person. Archie Davis was first U13 boy in the mini mile.<br /><br />7 [2:41:23] BONIFACE, Neil<br />18 [2:50:13] GREENWOOD, Michael <br />29 [2:54:36] HARDS, Darryl <br />56 [2:59:42] LIPPERT, Max-Patrick <br />90 [3:05:15] TOWNLEY, Mike <br />121 [3:08:46] PIKE, Jon <br />133 [3:10:45] BEARD, Leigh <br />230 [3:16:21] NOVIS, Robert <br />248 [3:17:29] FIELD, Andrew<br />269 [3:20:12] BONZI, Alexander <br />289 [3:20:35] HERRON, Nigel <br />299 [3:21:21] FRIEND, Brian <br />306 [3:22:47] POWELL, Dav<br />480 [3:28:42] WHYTE, Michael (pacer for 3:30)<br />771 [3:39:11] HARDS, Peter (Kim) <br />889 [3:41:51] LYONS, Ivan <br />962 [3:39:35] MITCHELL, Jon <br />1084 [3:46:02] McNALLY, Liam <br />1122 [3:44:40] BIBBY, Rachel<br />1161 [3:46:31] SHIELDS, Luke<br />1270 [3:51:45] AVEY, Terry <br />1318 [3:53:21] HOLBORN, Tony<br />1509 [3:53:08] SANDLANDS, Tess<br />1712 [3:54:33] WOODMAN, Tim (pacer for 4:00)<br />2507 [4:09:19] PERRY, Rachel <br />3321 [4:24:27] HALL, Joanne <br />3741 [4:32:10] GREGORY, Louise<br />3898 [4:40:01] KEMP, Malcolm <br />4419 [4:42:59] REGAN, Lucy <br />4729 [4:46:25] MELLO-COSTA, Ananda</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Photos by Reg Richardson and Andrew Haig</p>",

However, I appreciate that not everyone is &amp; I shall remain diplomatic in my approach; Archie ran in the recent XC league, where he &amp; Billy White made up the Phoenix team effort. If we could have got 1 more runner we would have done quite well in the team events</p>",

The handicapping worked quite well apart from a few obvious exceptions and most finished within a 3-4 mins time period. The &rsquo;t appreciate that !</p>\r\n<p >Conditions were (I will swop yours with mine please). Next home and posting the fastest time of the evening and just 3 seconds outs. Finn started last so managed to pass everyone else bar Andrew. 6<sup>th</sup> home in the handicap and fastest lady was Aimee Billington who posted the third best womens time ever. It was good to see almost half the field were ladies showing our new found strength or perhaps all the men were making dinner?</p>\r\n<p >Special award should go to Dav.</p>\r\n<p >Please pencil this in your diaries for next year</p>\r\n</div>",

Those of you keeping an eye on the weather may be surprised to hear that we got there and back with relative ease, apart from a small group who missed the scheduled return Eurostar train. (No names, no pack drill)<br /><br />We arrived just four hours late on Saturday evening, to find that Chairman Paul had managed to book us into four star luxury in the m. Time for a quick meal and just the one glass of beer before an early night (we are athletes after all). <br /><br />The format for Sunday is that the Iris Lotto CrossCup, an IAAF Permit meeting takes place throughout the day with races for all age groups run on a 1KM course. At 12:30 there is also a two lap 5K/10k event involving 1200+ runners. Both courses were effected by compacted and falling snow and, in the circumstances, everyone ran exceptionally well. These races feature high quality European fields and we fitted right in. In fact, there are a few people who've put themselves in line for England cons. We were especially pleased to have <strong>Tim Bayley</strong> AND <strong>Priscilla Bayley</strong> running for us.<br /><br />Running in the Minimes Filles category (1500m) <strong>Sian Bishop</strong> (Crawley) ran well for16th in 7:00<br /><br />Kicking off for Phoenix were <strong>Billy White</strong> and <strong>Robbie Fitzgibbon</strong> running in the Cadets Garcons category (2,500m). Both were in fine form with Billy coming 8th in 8:52 and Robbie 11th in 9:03.<br /><br />In the Scolaires Garcons category (4000m) <strong>Jake Elliot</strong> came an excellent 7th in 14:15.</p>\r\n<p>The junior women (4000m) featured Crawley athlete <strong>Abigail Ashbee-</strong><strong>Simmonds</strong> 10th in 16:14.<br /><br />All eyes were then on the junior men (6000m) with the performance of the day coming from Hasting's <strong>Adam Clarke</strong>. He came third in a time of 19:38 beating most of the runners selected for England. Next up was our own <strong>Finn McNally</strong> in imperious form for a 20:15 9th placing. His was the best Phoenix run of the day. Having come back from dropping out in Liverpool he rebuilt himself to finish just behind the England team. He was followed in quick succession by <strong>Charlie Grice</strong> 14th 20:33, <strong>James McCarthy</strong> (B&amp;H) 16th 20:49 and <strong>Max Pickard</strong> 20th 20:59. <strong>Jonas Wieneke</strong> running for his German club was 26th in 22:14.<br /><br />The senior men's race was won by nine-times European Cross-Country champion <strong>Sergiy Leb</strong> (31:27) with just 3 seconds covering the first three finishers on the 10,500m course. For Phoenix <strong>Tim Bayley</strong> was our lead runner 39th in 34:33 with <strong>Josh Guilmant</strong> coming 49th in 35:27.<br /><br />While all this was happening, the mass participation 10K and 5K races were taking place around outskirts of the park. Unfortunately we were unable to find our numbers and microchips so we won't appear in the results but they would have read something like this:<br /><br />10K <strong>James Miles</strong> 13th 34:26, <strong>Andrew Haig</strong> 233rd 43:03. Both James and Andrew fell heavily in the icy conditions, so well done to them.<br /><br />We can't quite locate the 5K results yet but <strong>Liz Durman</strong> ran an excellent 20+ (second woman), and<strong> Priscilla Bayley</strong> ran 22+.<br /><br />Throughout we had great support from the other members of our party especially the <strong>Pickards</strong>, the <strong>Grices</strong>, the <strong>Fitzgibbons</strong>, <strong>Sarah Davey</strong> and Josh's girlfriend <strong>Elin</strong> who had lived in Brussels for several years and was able to help out with local knowledge. <br /><br />That night, athletic circumspection was off and a good time was had by all. The town was looking fantastic with Christmas lights reflecting in the snow and the streets thronged with people. The night's celebration d't stop a group of younger athletes taking a run on the final morning. Most of those who made the first train back were then upgraded to a first . Travel chaos &ndash; what travel chaos?<br /><br />Finally a big thank you to Chairman <strong>Paul</strong>, who organised the whole thing. What with the disrupted travel and the missing numbers, he had his work cut out and even had to miss out on his own race as d<strong>Robin Fitzgibbon </strong>as he helped to sort out the numbers fiasco.</p>\r\n<p>The trip was a huge success and almost certain to be repeated next year &ndash; so watch this space.</p>",

Defending champions, the over 60s had to be content with silver this year. <strong>Andrew Haig</strong>, <strong>Terry Avey</strong> and <strong>Malcolm Kemp</strong> scored 6th, 7th and 8th respectively. How's that for packing! Respect though to Brighton and Hove (1st, 2nd, 5th) who took gold. Our fourth runner <strong>Rik Taub</strong> finished well up the field in 19th place.<br /><br />The over 40s have been just outs. The icing on the cake was beating Brighton and Hove into fourth place by just two points. The fast-improving <strong>Bruce Warren</strong> was our lead runner (12th) followed by scorers <strong>Dav</strong> (15th), <strong>Nigel Herron</strong> (16th) and <strong>Bruce Faulkner</strong> (20th). Again, good packing. <strong>Malcolm Hughes</strong> (23rd), <strong>John Marinko</strong> (24th) and <strong>Ro Harrington</strong> (34th) offered strong support. <br /><br />Two impressive runs in the over 50 category. <strong>Phil</strong> \"I can't run cross country\" <strong>Hampshire</strong> ran a stormer for 6th place with <strong>Brian Friend</strong> fresh off the plane from his Arizona marathon and still jet-lagged managing an excellent 15th. The absence of a third runner meant that they couldn't score as a team. <br /><br />Sadly no Phoenix women vets were available to run.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.sussexathletics.org.uk/results.php\">Full results</a><br /><br />Photos by <strong>Hitoshi Kobayashi</strong></p>",

He managed this despite having to overcome further health problems. Impressive Bruce! <br /><br />Every one knows that <strong>Terry Avey</strong> loves racing and his third placing in the tough V4 (55-59) category is his well-deserved reward. Despite turning 60 in early January, the SGP rules mean he has to compete in that age group all over again this year.<br /><br />In the Junior male category, although no runner completed more than two scoring races, <strong>Max Pickard</strong> was 1st and <strong>Tom Holborn</strong> 3rd.<br /><br />Highest placed women were <strong>Liz Hall</strong> 5th V3 and <strong>Carolyn Austen</strong> 5th V5.<br /><br />Phoenix were 8th club overall out of the 21 competing.<br /><br />For those still unaware of this competition. 18 road races (including Phoenix races) throughout the year, are designated as 'Grand Prix' . Your positioning scores points for the club and for you indiv. Your best eight performances (which, optimally, need to include two 10M+ runs) are scored. Even if you do fewer than the optimum number your score will still count.

Team manager Quenton Davis puts it this way: 'I think a combination of up-and-coming talent &amp; and our commitment to attendance in numbers saw us through'<br /><br /><strong>Archie Davis</strong> was first home in third place just 23 seconds off the lead. Archie was unlucky to miss out on the indiv. Then we had <strong>Matt Berr</strong> 7th, <strong>Reuben Hoyte</strong> 9th, <strong>Isaac Wright</strong> 12th, <strong>Will Russell</strong> 32nd and <strong>Josh White</strong> 40th. <strong>Joe Lillie</strong> was unlucky to have to withdraw with an injury.<br /><br />U15 boys featured two ever-reliable athletes <strong>Sam Kitchen</strong> 9th and <strong>Luke Reynolds</strong> 21st and place sixth for the year.</p>\r\n<p>There was no U17 boys team featuring at all in the results.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Charlotte Matthews</strong> ran well again for the U13s but without support the team was just 11th for the season. <strong>Jody Mann</strong> 6th, and <strong>Amber Muir</strong> 14th ran well for the under 15 girls but without a full team had to settle for 6th overall. <br /><br />The senior women fielded just two runners, <strong>Liz Durman</strong> 15th and <strong>Megan Lillie</strong> (U17) 42nd. After poor representation all season they languish 5th in the second division. <br /><br />The senior men again featured just two runners (<strong>James Miles</strong> an excellent 9th and <strong>Andrew Neighbour</strong> 69th) and had to depend on the vets for their scoring including 60+ runner <strong>Malcolm Kemp</strong>. They were inevitably well short of the medals in 5th place. The vet men have been reasonably represented during the season but were without their strongest team at Lancing. They held on to fifth place. <strong>Nigel Herron</strong> ran a terrific 34th and <strong>Malcolm Hughes</strong> 55th and <strong>Lance Bellers</strong> 67th were the other scorers.<br /><br />We need to dec, if so, what can we learn from the U13 boys team?</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sussexathletics.org.uk/results.php#270\">Full results</a></p>\r\n<p><em>Photos by Quenton Davis</em></p>",

With <strong>Dave Carter</strong> 8th and <strong>Daryll Hards</strong> 14th we were easily the leading team. Other notable performances were <strong>Bruce Warren</strong> 29th who's 1:18:50 knocks over 10 minutes off his previous best, <strong>Jim Whitelegg</strong> (1:26:20) who knocked 4 minutes plus off his and <strong>Paul Thomas</strong> (3:05:29) who also improved by a massive margin. <strong>Terry Avey</strong> (1:35:04) was first M60. The only flat note was the absence of Phoenix women with vet <strong>Carol Webb</strong> (1:47:22) the only representative.<br /><br />In the junior races there was a fantastic entry by the club with no fewer than 23 young athletes taking part in the race for 8&ndash;11 year olds. <strong>Isaac Wright</strong> won the event with <strong>Max Winter</strong> in second place. In the 12&ndash;16 event, <strong>Archie Davis</strong> came a fantastic second.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/index.htm\">Results</a><br /><br />Meanwhile big things had been happening on the Saturday. Firstly <strong>Will Durkin</strong> (JM 15&ndash;19) attempted the Hove Park time trials for the first time and walked away with it, winning the event in 16:28, a massive 32 seconds ahead of the next runner.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.parkrun.org.uk/brighton/Results\">Results</a><br /><br />Last, but no means least, <strong>Josh Guilmant</strong> ran the English Cross-country championships at Alton Towers and placed a mighty 44th. Josh ran 38:27 with the race won in 35:11. Great performance Josh.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.englishcrosscountry.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;&amp;Item\">Results</a></p>",

Arch-rivals Brighton and Hove  led for the early laps but the <strong>Phoenix senior men's team</strong> took fire and emerged the winners by almost a minute. <br /> <br /> After two legs of the six-stage relay (the course is 2.05 miles) it looked as though our chance was gone. <strong>Will Durkin</strong> had put in a steady 10:14 for leg 1. <strong>Max Pickard</strong> then had what he would concede was a difficult run on second leg (10:53) leaving us in 6th position. <strong>Finn McNally</strong> steadied the ship with a fine 10:09 and then <strong>Josh Guilmant</strong> put in a captain's performance running a stunning 9:55 which proved to be the fastest run of the day. Then it got tastier as <strong>Tom Hopkins</strong> handed over a lead to <strong>Charlie Grice</strong> having run 10:01 (third fastest). Charlie needed no better invitation  and blasted his way round the course in 9:56. His time would have given  him second fastest lap behind Josh's first but as an under 17 runner he  took gold in that category. The under 17 indiv<strong>Will Durkin</strong> silver and <strong>Jake Elliot</strong>, running for the senior B team, taking third spot (10:36). <br /> <br /> 'Our' senior B team included a fine selection of athletes including <strong>Ben  Warren</strong> from Harrow AC, our own <strong>Garry Thayre</strong> (not far off 50) and Liz  Durman's dad <strong>Garry</strong> <strong>Durman</strong> &ndash; a fine athlete in his day. A non-scoring team but a fun one!<br /> <br /> In the same race (four legs) the over 40 men fielded two complete teams with the A team making 4th spot. <strong>Ray Matthews</strong> was our fastest runner with 11:26.<br /> <br /> Earlier, other teams had set the pace. In the under-13 boys race we finished in silver position with <strong>Reuben Hoyte</strong> (6:24), <strong>Archie Davis</strong> (6:12) and <strong>Matt Berr</strong> (6:40) continuing their remarkable success story, backed up by a fine B team (<strong>Will Russell</strong>, <strong>Harry Swindels</strong> and <strong>Joe Lillie</strong>). <strong>Archie Davis</strong> took indiv.<br /> <br /> The under-13 girls were the only other junior category to field a team. Well done to <strong>Eve Hull, Alex V</strong> and <strong>Elorah Mann</strong>.<br /> <br /> The women, with a senior A and B team ran alongs.  Same course but just three legs. The women's A team with <strong>Erica Martin</strong> running a fine 12:17 first leg managed 7th place in a fiercely fought race.<br /> <br /> The O50 men also had two teams in the mix with <strong>Bob Novis</strong> running 12:29 for their fastest leg. The reward was an excellent 4th place for the A team.<br /> <br /> The O60men have a great record in this event, and we rose to the  occasion once more with a strong (and remarkably evenly matched) trio  who took team gold just 19 seconds ahead of defending champions,  Brighton and Hove. How are these for timings? <strong>Malcolm Kemp</strong> 13:25, <strong>Terry Avey</strong> 13:23, <strong>Andrew Field</strong> 13:24. Congratulations gents!<br /> <br /> Full results can be found <a href=\"http://www.sussexathletics.org.uk/results.php#277\">here</a> <br /> <br /> Thanks to <strong>Lance Bellers</strong> for these excellent shots.</p>",

The  managers for that age group, Quenton Davis Jude Matthews and Paul V.<br /> <br /> An improved turnout from the boys compared to the first match last  season and some great performances meant we took 3rd spot in the boys  competition (only 5 pts behind Brighton &amp; Hove in 2nd) our highest  for some time.The boys excelled onthe track and in the jumps which was  highlighted in our overall position cons.The evening was rounded offwith avery  excitingPhoenix double winning relay finale. <br /> <br /> The girls all put in a big effort, showed great attitude and team spirit  and had a lot of fun.This was the first of these events we've taken  part in and we had a fairly small group so weren't able to take part in  (and so score points) all the events so overall a great performance  which we'll build on over the rest of the season.</p>\r\n<p>U13 <a href=\"../../../results\">results</a></p>",

We had our fair  share of injuries, falls and heatstroke problems but also a lot of  laughs and good companionship throughout the day.</p>\r\n<p>Athletically too  there were some sensational performances, notably by Tom Hopkins (two  all-time Phoenix leg records) and Dav(one Phoenix vet leg  record).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks are due to Liz Hall's  team and Andy Bone who organised the Vet's team and the A team for the  men. Andy also drove the vet's support vehicle, Ro Harrington drove the  women's van and Petra Kopp the A team van. Thanks to them and to Bruce  Warren who helped out as well. Our friend Hitoshi Koboyashi was also on  board gathering material for an article in the Japanese Runners World. Thanks too to supporters who cheered us on at Ditchling Beacon.</p>\r\n<p>No more words (until the results are published). Instead, take a  look at these great photographs by Lance Bellers.

With chip-timing and well -organised facilities such as  toilet provision, baggage tent, massage, PA (great work Tim) etc, the  overall impression was highly favourable and bodes well for the future.</p>\r\n<p>Congratulations have to go to Andy Bone who has steered the event  with consumate organisational skill. The marshalling and bike-leading  too was excellent with Liz Hall, Elana Moore, Malcolm Kemp and  others in control. Particularly heartening was the raucus reception  committee of junior athletes, organised by John Marinko, at the 5K  turnaround point.</p>\r\n<p>It also turned out to be a high quality race  with a thrilling sprint finish. Dean Lacey of Cambr's Ian Leitch by three seconds.  Josh Guilmant of Phoenix was just 30 seconds back in third place.  Phoenix won the men's team prize (Leitch, Guilmant, Hopkins, Hards). A  special mention too for Terry Avey who's running has transformed this  season. He was first in the over-60 category against a quality field in  that age-group, with a superb sub-40 run. Amazingly, this is his  eighteenth age-group first this season.</p>\r\n<p>In the women's race Emma  Richards of Hailsham Harriers was run away winner in 37:35, a substantial PB for her. The next two places were fought out by two V45 athletes. Elspeth Turner of Horsham Blue Stars was second in 38:17 and Cathy Ulliot of Brighton and Hove was third in 40:13.</p>\r\n<p>Thirty Phoenix runners took part and almost the same number were on marshalling and other duties. Well done everybody.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to Lance Bellers for the photos</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"../../../results\">Results</a></p>",

Josh finally  putting in a 14 30 clocking in the 5000m would be stepping down and  trying to lower his time the third successive 3k race in a row before  calling it a day. While both Finn and Max had unfinished business,  having not hit the times they are capable of over this distance. <br /> The race went off at a fair pace with all four in early contention, it  was not long before Charlie took the lead and slowly increased the pace  with a real push for home in the final two laps finishing with a winning  time of 8.21 (PB) and with far more there for next season. Josh came home  in a respectable 8.30 some five seconds adrift of his PB with Max having  his best run of the season in 8.34 smashing his PB, and Finn returning to form also hitting a PB of  8.38.</p>\r\n<p>results<br />http://www.watfordharriers.org.uk/indexnc.htm</p>\r\n<p></p>",

For Phoenix this is the Southern Championship which also happens to be the hardest qualifying race of the three regional championships, and usually requires a group of men in their late 20s and early 30s to deal with length of the race and toughness of the terrain. Team Phoenix this time round however were entering their youngest ever team to a senior championship, with an average age of 19 &frac12; years, but luckily these guys are disciplined to their sport and were up to the task in hand.</p>\r\n<p>Finn Mcnally coming off his 31.25 10k two weeks earlier was given the task of leading the team off on the always hotly contested first leg, and with what has come accustom with his racing , going with the pace and at times through the first of the two lap course setting it. Finn was reward for his aggressive racing .57. Second up was Max Pickard who managed to hold the same place that Finn brought the team in on (17th). Next up was Charlie Grice who gradually edged the team up 3 places to hand over to the youngest member of the team Jake Elliott who managed to keep the team in the mix even though he was making a huge step up in the age of the runners he is used to competing against. Sam Wade taking the penultimate leg travailed all the way from Wales just to make this race for the team, and even though he suffered from a massive nose bleed half way round the course he held it together to hold on to his position. Last up was Josh Guilmant who had been quite ill for 2 days before the race but with a lack of senior men to replace him, he dec.</p>\r\n<p>Huge credit must be given to Paul Collicutt who travailed up with the team and was on hand to step in for the ill Guilmant had he been needed.</p>\r\n<p>Only a day before the Junior Boys were showing just how strong the next generation of athletes could be with a fantastic 5th place in the Under 13 Age group. Top performance in the team was Matthew Berr.57, this was 13th fastest on the day. He was backed up by his very strong team mates of Reuben Hoyte, Isaac Wright and Archie Davis who will all now be turning their attention to the cross country season.</p>",

Matt has been in great shape in recent weeks after a fine performance in the southern 6 stage last week, this week was no different as he put the race beyond any doubt with a time of 9:54 the fastest of the day and the tenth fastest ever. Archie Davis was left with little to do on the final leg but pushed the pace all the same coming home to take the team gold in the second fastest time of the day 9.59 and a team course record of 30.07, nearly 2 minutes ahead of Hastings in second. Harry Swindells, Joe Lillee, Ollie Johnson committed themselves fantastically coming home in 5th place to show that the under 13s have strength and depth. Hopefully in the coming months they will all be able to push each other on as the cross country season gets into full swing.</p>\r\n<p><br />The under 15 girls team was made up of Amber Muir, Jody Mann and Maria Andrews all ran well in their first taste of cross country this year.</p>\r\n<p><br />The Phoenix ladies made a good effort to put together two teams at short notice; fastest on the day was Liz Hall. Sonal Chaudhary, Lesley Fairburn, Deb Friis all competed well<br /><br />The veteran men picked up a deserved bronze medal even with their fastest man and vet team captain in the B team, John Marinko who selflessly put himself in the B squad having thought that his morning bike r. The bronze medal winning team was made up of Malcolm Hughes, Dav, Paul Collicutt and Darren Elliott while the B team of John Marinko, Stuart Pal, Roland Harrington and Colin Simpson showed that there good numbers on the vets s.</p>\r\n<p><br />As the Under 13&rsquo;s started the day in dominating fashion the senior men certainly finished it off in the same way. There was talk before the race that two of the new additions to the team could not run but with a detailed check of the rules the A team were ready to do some damage. This squad was not just the strongest team Phoenix has had but the best team ever assembled for the Sussex Cross Country Relays by any competing club. So the question was not whether the A team would win but how many records would be broken in the process. Such is the depth on the men&rsquo;s s. The race kicked off with Jon Pepper showing why he is one of the up and coming national standard distance runners to watch as he took full control of the race from the start, his compact , as he came into the finishing straight the clock was reading 11.XX and with no one ever running sub 12 at Goodwood Jon was on course for a record breaking time. He handed over in a time of 11.33 a course record by some 40 odd seconds!!! Next up was Josh Guilmant who was still fighting the tail end of a virus he had picked up the week before when helping his team make certain of their place at the nationals championships in two weeks time. The virus d. As the A team were chancing records the B team were slowly working their way through the pack as Jake Elliott showed the potential he will have as a senior with the fastest time by an Under 17 athlete on the day a time of 12.41, this placed him nicely in the mix for Tom Hopkins to give chase. Tom these days is more accustom to do his running after a swim and a bike having moved over to triathlon over a year ago however he is still a canny runner having set one of the fastest time back in April in the County Road Relays championships and with a time of 12.30 the B team were well in the hunt. Going on to the penultimate leg for the A team Ben Tickner used his most favoured racing &ldquo;hit it hard then hit it harder&rdquo; to come home in a time of 11:34 just one second shy of Jon&rsquo;s new course record. Darryl Hardes at this point was holding position well in the B team having not raced on the Cross Country seen for some years, Darryl is no new boy to cross country and he had not forgotten how to judge his effort. All but Charlie Grice getting lost on the last leg the A team were now heading for victory and the shorter distance of the 4k loop suited Charlie far more coming off 8/15&rsquo;s racing in the summer than the 6k he ran last week in the southern champs. A time of 12.02 was good enough for third fastest in the team and ducked under the previous record, because of the standard of the team this year this was also third fastest overall. All three indiv, which added up to a massive team course record 47:35 this may take some years to better. While the A team were home with 2 minutes to spare Max Pickard was fighting it out on the last leg for the B team and even with Darryl&rsquo;s effort on the third leg they were still lying down in fourth place. Max always runs with his heart on his sleeve and when he saw another runner cutting in on the course an argument ensued. With most athletes this would break there concentration but not Max like John McEnroe this just pushes him on to another level and he soon moved in to third place and pulled away for the bronze. It must be sa. Max&rsquo;s time would have been very close to also going under the previous indiv.</p>\r\n<p><br />The Senior Men&rsquo;s work for the day was now complete and meant that Phoenix now hold both the Road and Cross Country Team Championship.</p>",

          "content": "<p>Team Phoenix went into the National Championships with five of the original six from the Southern Championship team making the journey. With the added addition of the ever reliable and sure footed Tom Hopkins stepping in for Jake Elliott, and it was Tom who was given the task of leading the team off on what is the hottest leg of any relays competition in the UK.</p>\r\n<p><br />The start begins with a sharp downhill section on a tight path with lots of twists and turns. To say it almost results in a fight off the line would not be far from the reality as the best athletes in the UK go toe to toe to get the best start and at the same time limit their time loses. Tom opted to stay out of trouble in the m. He handed over to Max Pickard nicknamed the Honey Badger for his tenacious running , Max managed to move the team up 13 places in a time of 18.39. Sam Wade took over on leg 3 and must have been putting in some serous training in the weeks since the Southern Champs as he had the most improved run of the day to hold position but move ahead of Brighton and Hove AC. Next up was Charlie Grice who put down the fastest time of the day 18.21 close to the club record of 18.14 held by Tom Naylor, he moved the team up 11 places to 39th position. Josh Guilmant has not been at his best all month with a virus but still managed to progress the team a further 2 places and at this level any slight improvement takes a lot of work. Finn McNally Running the final leg has been adjusting to his new environment at Birmingham University and as such his time was down in comparison to his huge run at the Southern&rsquo;s. Finn does not give up easily though, pushing the team up 5 more place to 32nd over all out of 76 finishing teams this was the 12th best result by a southern team and the second best by a phoenix team in these Championships, the best result coming a whole decade earlier by the 1998 team who finished 20th.</p>\r\n<p><br />What was so pleasing about this result is the fact that five of the seven runners who were in the Southern and National teams were under 20 meaning that in the next few years there is the distinct possibility that Team Phoenix can contest for a top 20 placing. Much of the success by the juniors can be put down to a strong youth policy where the emphasis is on tailoring training to specific needs of the athlete while still working off each other as a team.</p>\r\n<p><br />Phoenix in affect has one of the smallest teams to compete at these championships but with a small team comes a tight knit group of athletes junior and senior, that still manages to punch well above their weight. <br />Huge credit must be give to Joel K. Well done to Ben Tickner compeating for his first claim club Wells 3rd on leg one is some run!</p>\r\n<p><br />Phoenix Men end the 2011 season as the undisputed number one relay team in Sussex with wins in Sussex Road and Cross Country championships as well as the highest finishes by a country mile in the southern and now the national championships.</p>",

Special mentions to Max, who although U20 won the senior men&rsquo;s race, which had its largest field for some time, also to Erica, who in her own words had her best x-country race for some time and although third overall was first senior women.</p>\r\n<p>The league is not just about indiv, every place matters. It was therefore pleasing to see that the fine indiv, with team victories in the U13 and U17 boys. A more detailed report for the U13 boys can be seen below, unfortunately Isaac Wright suffered an injury in the U13 race and we wish him a speedy recovery. It was good to see complete teams in the U13 girls and senior women, who in the past have struggled to make teams. It was noted that it was up to Max and the &lsquo;older&rsquo; men to make up the numbers in the senior men&rsquo;s team, with Donald Maclellan running his first x-country race for Phoenix leading the Phoenix vets home. Donald also won the post race cake eating prize!</p>\r\n<p>Well done to all those who attended, the next league races are on November 26th at Plumpton.</p>\r\n<p><strong>U13 boys report by Quenton Davis</strong> - We went into the first league match conf, even with the absence of Reuben Hoyte from that gold medal winning team. With six boys available on the day we were also conf. Matt Berr, a tactic that saw them steadily work clear of Lewes in third place. By the last 200m the two Phoenix boys were well clear and the inform Matt Berr. <br />Ollie Johnson came home in 15th place in his ma. The B team were looking good for a m, Joe Lillee and Harry Swindells but unfortunately Isaac sustained what appears to be a pretty serious knee injury in the last third of the race. At twelve years old and a talented competition cyclist this could very likely end Isaac's cross country season; we all wish him a speedy recovery. The B team still managed a fantastic 12th position and hopefully with the three or four good runners we still have to call on we can push the B team up the table over the last three matches.</p>",

Everyone connected with the club must be aware of the achievement recently of our younger members on track, road and country as well as the successes by our triathletes including one current world champion. We are a club very much looking forward, punching above our weight and not resting on our laurels. That's enough of the mixed metaphors! <br /><br />The awards formed the first part of the celebration and then it was on with the food, the drinks and the dancing. Nerine Standen's husband Joe d. Andy Bone had managed to acquire a serious looking barrel of Harveys to stand alongs. Very little of anything was left by the end of the evening. We're a hungry and thirsty lot, we athletes. Then the lights dimmed and turntable maestro Rik Taub began to tempt us on to the dance floor. What a set! Once on, there was no quitting.<br /><br />So thanks to Andy Bone and Ray Matthews who organised the event and to all those who helped out. Congratulations to the award winners. It was such a success that there is talk about doing a combined party and awards ceremony every year.

Eleven months late has to some kind of record for SCAAA.</p>\r\n<p>At the Crowborough 10K on 6 November, a county official approached Andrew Haig clutching a weighty bag of medals. It appears that ten of us had contributed to our success. With 176 points, we were just a whisker behind gold medallists Hailsham Harriers on 157 points. Think what we might have done had we known we were competing. <br /><br />The medal winners were: <strong>Josh Guilmant, Bruce Faulkner, Tom Fars, Tom Holborn, Bruce Warren, Terry Avey, Max Pickard, James Miles, Daren Elliot</strong> and <strong>Andrew Haig</strong>.<br /><br />The sole aim of this challenge, put on by Sussex AA, is to improve the standard of road running in the county. This year the five races designated were:<br />Chichester (Feb), Heathfield (Jun), Bexhill (Sep), Crowborough (Nov) and Brighton (Nov).</p>\r\n<p>Indiv. For teams it is enough to have three scorers of any standard in four of the five events. With just the Brighton 10k to come and having scored as a team at only Chichester and Crowborough, it doesn't look like we are going to trouble the leader board in 2011.</p>",

          "content": "<p>The new look Phoenix Races took off like a rocket on Sunday. For the first time in 30 years we had both Sun and Warmth for the start of the event. The Under 11 girls showcased the next generation of talented youngsters coming into our sport with a titanic battle between Amber Anning, Almi Nerurkar and Naomi Fonteyn. These three athletes are surely going to be entertaining us with close races over the next few years. Running exactly the same time as Amber Anning her teamate from Brighton and Hove Joe Barker won the Under 11 boys with Phoenix /Lancing Prep&rsquo;s Charlie Warren 4 seconds behind in third.<br /><br />This years Fr. Phoenix's Will Durkin shared the same time as Dan Stepney in a new course record of 4:36. In fact they almost shared the same pair of shoes as they crossed the line together with Will just outleaning Dan. Worthing's Mark Burchett took third place having lead early on. It was good to see Phoenix star Flo Pepper back in racing action as she took the women's race from Abigail Ashbee Simmonds in a time of 5:12.<br /><br />Crawley dominated the Under 13 girls race with Rebecca Chee a fine winner. They also had 2nd and 4th and easily took the team title. First Phoenix athlete home was Elorah Mann who had her best run out for the club so far. It was also great to see so many Phoenix vests in this race. In the boys race Archie Davis turned the tables on Matthew Berr. Phoenix also took the team title as Harry Swindells had a brilliant run for 4th place. Not far behind were Max Winter, Jack Etherton and Millan Donna. The Under 13 boys are looking good in depth this year.<br /><br />The under 9 girls saw yet another of the super speedy racing Cooks from Bodyworks win as Bethany Cook triumphed beating Phoenix athlete Lydia Whitworh into second place. The under 9 girls had 74 finishers! Bethany's team mate Leo Standen Payne took the boys race. there was drama here just before the finish as Lukas Nerurkar who had been on the shoulder of the winner fell just before the grass finish. Gamely he got up to finish in third place as Daniel westwood passed him.<br /><br />The smallest field of the day was in the U15/ U17 girls race. Grace Cook led Bodyworks to the team title with a runaway victory in the U 15s and Lauren Bourne of Worthing took the U17s. In the boys races we saw some determined front running from Jake Elliott to take the U17 title and it was great to see the ever improving Ryan Elson get 2nd in this race. Billy White was dominant in the U15s and sam Kitchen had perhaps his best distance race so far as he passed top County runner Jake Algar for 2nd place. With Will Russell running strongly for 8th place Phoenix won the team event.<br /><br />The new course was well received by the athletes and created great spectator opportunities as you could see the entire race unfold. Now if only we can guarantee the weather next year.<br /><br />Many thanks to all our sponsors...Geneva investments, Fr, Saucony and the Brighton Marathon who prov. Even more thanks to all the volunteers who helped out on the day and congratulations to Dav.</p>\r\n<p>Photos courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.sussexsportphotography.com\">www.sussexsportphotography.com</a> and Lance Bellers</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"../../documents/results\">Provisional results</a></p>",

Championship (BUCS). Sam has made a big improvement in his distance running of late and combined with a strong bike was able to put it all together to put himself on the podium.</p>\r\n<p >Ian Leitch returned to the mud and grass of cross country after an absence of 20 years to place 5<sup>th</sup> in the London Championships, with more success sure to come when he gets back to full fitness.</p>\r\n<p >Max Pickard has run the Brighton Park Run 5k over 15 times never with a win, this Saturday he showed he has moved up in .38 to move to 11<sup>th</sup> on the all time list, still an under 20.</p>\r\n<p ></p>\r\n<p ><strong>Brighton 10k Sussex Championships</strong></p>\r\n<p >Almost perfect conditions, although the breeze from the east made the last few kilometres a challenge. Good turnout from Phoenix. This was also the Sussex 10K championships. As far as I can see our County medal winners are Terry Avey with silver in the over 60 category and Bob Novis with bronze in the over 50s.<br /> <br /> 113 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Joe Francis</span></strong> 37:39<br /> 116 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Miles Dav</span></strong> 37:39<br /> 117 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Bruce Warren</span></strong> 37:42<br /> 131 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Jon Pike</span></strong> 38:14<br /> 137 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Daren Elliot</span></strong> 38:27<br /> 142 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Donald McClellan</span></strong> 38:41<br /> 167 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Bob Novis </span></strong>39:09<br /> 237 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Terry Avey</span></strong> 40:48<br /> 260 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Lance Bellers</span></strong> 41:12<br /> 266 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Dave Powell</span></strong> 41:15<br /> 285 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Stuart Pal</span></strong> 41:30<br /> 396 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Roland Harrington</span></strong> 42:51<br /> 490 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">John Lamb</span></strong> 44:48<br /> 556 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sonal Chaudhary</span></strong> 45:29<br /> 600 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Paule Kremer </span></strong>45:59<br /> 1182 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Leslie Fairbairn</span></strong> 50:51<br /> 1567 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Catherine Walsh</span></strong> 54:59<br /> 1986 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Stuart Batchelor</span></strong> 1:02:02<br /> 2623 <strong><span &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Paul Thomas</span></strong> 1:15:54</p>",

There are 17 teams  competing for honours in that age group and Phoenix are placed in a  healthy fifth place.<br /> <br /> The enthusiasm for cross country seems to have grabbed hold of the  entire club. The under 13 boys fielded no fewer than 9 runners (<strong>Archie  Davis</strong> and <strong>Matt Berr</strong> scoring their familiar one two followed by <strong>Sam  Betts</strong>, <strong>Reuben Hoyte</strong>, <strong>Harry Bartley</strong>, <strong>Oliver Johnson</strong>, <strong>Harry Swindells</strong>, <strong>Joe  Lillie</strong> and <strong>Jack Etherton</strong>) and are in gold medal position after another  fantastic performance. Senior men and vets had 14 on the start line (<strong>Ben  Tickner</strong> first and <strong>Josh Guilmant</strong> third) and, most encouragingly, there  were eight competitors in the women's race. <strong>Catherine Bounds</strong> was first home in an excellent run for 14th place.</p>\r\n<p><br /> <a href=\"../../../results\">Results roundup</a></p>",

Making the long trip up north to Liverpool were Charlie Grice, Max Pickard, Finn McNally and Jon Pepper (running for his first claim London Club of Enfield)<br />First up were the under 20 Men with Max, who has been in great form in recent weeks with a win at Goodwood CX where he turned over all the seniors as well as winning his age group, and a new PB and win at Brighton Park Run. Charlie was also in good shape going into this race although exactly what shape could not be known as he had just flown back from Kenya after having a month at altitude with the GB endurance squad in preparation. Needless to say with such a strong line up and with so much on the line in terms of GB honours the race went off at a blistering pace, faster than the senior men&rsquo;s race to follow. Charlie was caught between a rock and a hard place in having been detached from the leading group he had to make all the moves to try and close down the gap to nail down a top 6 finish but having to do so much of the work into the wind he came up just short in 9th place, but will be hopeful to be picked for the England team that is travailing to Brussels for the Loto Cross Cup. Although disappointed not to make the top 6 this still ranks as his best CX performance to date and shows a notable improvement in his distance running. Max&rsquo;s race d.</p>\r\n<p>The Senior Men&rsquo;s race was probably the most difficult to call at the front end for some time with a string of 20 runners in the mix at any point in time, Jon will be disappointed not to have finished higher up coming home in 25th position, not a true reflection of the shape he is in. Finn having made his move up to Birmingham University seems to have settled in with a really gutsy 14th in the under 23 race(64 overall) , and must rank as his best race since his 10k in the summer, not far off an England call up. <br /><br />V</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.athleticos.org/v/521149-Liverpool-Euro-Trials-2011-Junior-Men\">http://www.athleticos.org/v/521149-Liverpool-Euro-Trials-2011-Junior-Men</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.athleticos.org/v/520706-Liverpool-Euro-Trials-2011-Senior-Men\">http://www.athleticos.org/v/520706-Liverpool-Euro-Trials-2011-Senior-Men</a></p>",

After the first false start in a Brighton Park Run history, Ben Tickner took control of the race with a 2.50 opening kilometre. Sitting just behind him were Charlie Grice and Jon Pepper, with Will Durkin slightly further back. Such was the speed Tickner set up front with his aggressive front running .33. Not far off at this point were Charlie and Jon working together to keep Ben in sight while cutting their way through the back markers. As Ben moved on to the last part of the final lap it was clear that he was going to take the record but he was not happy with just that and buried himself for an exceptional 14.30, some 20 seconds off the course record. When you get indiv, and Jon moving clear on the third lap from Charlie came home in 14.44 to go under the record and only 2 seconds behind and just 18 years old Charlie came in with a time of 14.46 also under the previous record. Massive runs on what is by no means an easy course. 4th in was Will in 15.56, another big break though for him taking 30 seconds off his PB and moving him well up the leader board At only 17 years of age, this shows that the youth development is working with great effect. (all receive Phoenix Honey Badger status) <br />Not to be out done by her husband, Flo Pepper had her best race back from a long layoff to improve her PB to 17.57 and go 7th in the all time rankings and top of the Phoenix rankings.</p>\r\n<p>This means that Phoenix hold the 3 top positions at Park Run, 5 of the top 6 performances and 9 of the top 15 performances, not bad for a small club.</p>\r\n<p>Men<br />1.

England athletics took Junior and Senior teams to this race (4 in each category). I was really looking forward to this race after a couple of tough weeks at college! It was my first race for England over cross country and it shows how much I have improved over the last year. We travelled out on Saturday morning from St Pancras by Eurostar which was very efficient dropping us off at Brussels and then taking a couple of tube stations to the very nice hotel we were staying in, right in the m. The race was on Sunday and we were returning on Monday morning so it was a very short trip!<br /><br />When it came to race day I knew that Brussels is notoriously muddy and cold! Last year it snowed and it was snowing before my race although luckily it d. I was in the Junior Men&rsquo;s race, running with boys that could potentially be 19 years old. The race was 6km and extremely muddy! I was literally covered from head to toe and I even had it all over my face! Unlike any cross country races in the UK, the loops were 1km long! We had 6 laps to do which got a bit tedious but I d&rsquo;t mind it because I am a 1500m runner it feels quite quick and I can split the race up in my head quite nicely. There was also a bell for the signal of the last lap which was pretty cool as that only happens in track races! The race was tough, with a couple of hills. I started off in 9th place and worked my way through pacing myself nicely and moving through to 6th. I then overtook a couple of people up the last hill before str. I came 2nd for the England team which was above where I was expected to come so I was pleased. It was nice to be in the England team as so much of this sport is indiv.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://charliegrice.com/\">http://charliegrice.com/</a></p>",

The pace was clearly too slow for Ben and not far into the race he made his move and quickly opened up a gap of 15m on the rest of the field who&rsquo;s only excuse for missing the move being that they could not see past the 6.5 frame of Guilmant. This turned out to be a perfect team move to give Ben some breathing space and put some early pressure on the opposition.

A crop of Team Phoenix m, along with some of the more senior members of the club.<br /><br />Needless to say Jon got the race underway in a brisk fashion pushing the pace from the gun, he was joined unexpectedly by Chris Dodd (Bristol) for the first lap; increasing the pace like a silent assassin on the second lap Dodd was dropped and was caught by Josh and Max working together to stay in touch with the pace set by Jon. Slightly further back and encased in their own battle was Jake, Billy, Joel (JK), Jose, Gus and Sam, all training partners battling for position. Although Gus is more known for his exploits over 400m, he remarked that he was only there to show how running can be made sexy on the road when he runs. Back up front Jon was moving on to the last lap and dodging other runners like land mines in his own private battle to get home before Ben&rsquo;s time two weeks ago, coming up just short but still massively impressive he crossed the line in 14.38. Not far back Chris just about got the better of Josh and Max with a 15.03 to 15.04 and 15.06, it was remarked after that had there been less runners to get past the course record could of gone and 2nd 3rd and 4th place could all have gone under the magical 15 minute barrier, a big achievement on this course. Josh&rsquo;s time was a new age record but the big result of the day was Max taking 30 seconds off his time, probably his best run to date. In 8th place Billy had a huge run to smash his age group record on his first attempt with a 16.33 just staying ahead of the semi retired JK who led the others in.<br /><br />Well done to all of the 24 athletes of Team Phoenix that ran, and a special mention to Will RUSSELL on completing his 89th park run, as a junior athlete that is some record.<br /><br />Results<br /><br />1 Jon PEPPER 14:39 Course PB<br />3 Josh GUILMANT 15:04 Course PB Age Group Record<br />4 Max PICKARD 15:06 Course PB<br />6 Jake ELLIOTT 16:30<br />8 Billy WHITE 16:33 Course PB Age Group Record<br />9 Joel KIDGER 16:40 First time Course PB<br />10 Jose Gregorio LUCERON MUNOZ 16:45 Course PB<br />12 Gus KENNEDY 17:40 Course PB while looking GOOD<br />13 Samuel KITCHEN 17:44 First time Course PB<br />16 Daren ELLIOTT 17:57 Course PB<br />20 Gary THAYRE 18:20<br />23 Jon PIKE 18:31 Course PB<br />40 Brian FRIEND 19:23 Course PB<br />52 Andrew NEIGHBOUR 19:51<br />53 Lance BELLERS 19:57<br />70 Malcolm Leon KEMP 20:31 Course PB<br />85 Andrew HAIG 21:02<br />93 Simon ROBERTS 21:11<br />115 Will RUSSELL 21:38<br />140 Will FLEWETT 22:10<br />165 Iain MARTIN 22:50<br />211 Lukas NERURKAR 24:13 First time Course PB<br />229 Jake MATHIESON 24:56 Course PB<br />404 Marie BELCHER 30:36<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.parkrun.org.uk/brighton/photos\">Photo Credit Brighton Park Run</a></p>",

          "content": "<p>As is always the way at the county championship the youngest age group athletes got proceedings underway, and in the fine . As they broke from the woods, Archie got a warning call from the watching supporter and Phoenix Chief Mentor Joel K, he looked back expecting to see his team mate Matt approaching fast, but was surprised to see it was Matt Herring (Hastings) bearing down on him. The benefits of the &lsquo;Monday Night&rsquo; training sessions kicked in and Archie held off the challenge to win gold by 3 seconds. Matt fought off a strong challenge from the Hastings&rsquo; second runner to take the bronze medal, and with Ollie Johnson coming home in 9th place we were ensured the team gold medal. It was a shame we had 2 of our successful Aldershot Road Relay team pull out on the day, as strong runs from Harry Bartley (10th) and Harry Swindells (14th) would have seen the B team make a serious challenge for another team medal. We also had great runs from Max Winter (36th) and Jack Etherton (38th) both pretty much competing at this level for the first time. Well done guys another quality display. <br /><br />The Under 15 Girls were missing just one runner to score a team but both Jody Mann and Madeline Houghton ran well in a tough race. As to be expected Billy White delivered when it counted in the Under 15 Boys using his strong powerful build to put the power down when it mattered and keep himself out of trouble to take the title by 16 seconds. Backing him up well Sam Kitchen had a strong run to finish 6th while Will Russell showed real heart to close out the team and pick up his first county medal, with a team bronze. <br /><br />The Under 17&rsquo;s Boys race was the tightest of the day with the Phoenix guys unlucky not to win gold in the indiv. Jake Elliott was lying in third place for most of the race, closing the gap on the top two, team mate Will Durkin and Ian Crowe-Write (Brighton) when he made a wrong turn, unlucky for someone who is usually so sharp on detail, if only there had been a marshal located on that part of the course. However with Jake&rsquo;s (13th) unlucky error, Will Thompson (making his Phoenix debut) stepped up to the plate to put a cracking run in to come home 4th and move up a level, with Robbie Fitzgibbon closing out the last team spot in 10th with his smooth effortless . Back up front Will was battling it out for the gold but in the dying meters he just lost out to Ian, but this is sure just to focus Will even more come the next race and his big focus of the coming summer track season. <br /><br />The senior Women have been rebuilding the team of late and despite missing some of their usual runners the ladies were still able to field a team of 6 runners. Although this wasn't quite up to the number of men running, it shows that the numbers of ladies giving up some time to compete for the club over the country is increasing. As usual there was a great atmosphere within the team and everyone supported each other well.</p>\r\n<p>First home for the team was Erica Martin in 15th, returning after missing quite a lot of training through illness. Next home was Anita, having a good run and finishing strongly in 24th place. Paule continued to improve in 33rd place and showed signs that her marathon training is playing off. Run of the day went to Lesley who had a brilliant and very determined sprint finish to complete the team finishing in 52nd.<br />Returning from injury and competing in only her 2nd cross country race, Emma Hughes had a good run to finish 55th and Sonal completed the team in 60th place. Well done also to Phoenix trained Abigail Ashbee Simmonds coming home in silver medal position in the Under 20&rsquo;s race.</p>\r\n<p>With Charlie Grice on international duty the day before up in Edinburgh, it was left to Max Pickard to fly the Phoenix flag alone in the Under 20&rsquo;s Men&rsquo;s race, although Grice had made the journey back the same day to watch the team. Max&rsquo;s main opposition for the title would come in the form of Ross Skelton (Hastings), but he was in fine shape coming into this race with a massive run around the always testing Hove Park: Park-Run, where he smashed his best for the distance with a 15.06 5k. With the gun sounding Max jumped straight to the front of the pack to take control of the race, but with such a strong move in the early stages and Ross sitting just behind him he was putting all his marbles in one basket and when Ross made his move going up the long and testing drag into the woods on the second lap he gaped Max leaving him isolated in second, the only consolation was that there battle had taken them well ahead of the rest of the field, guaranteeing him silver, but not what he came for.</p>\r\n<p>The Sussex Cross Country Championships have been taking place since 1925 and with our club inauguration in the early 1980&rsquo;s to cater more specifically for the needs of the athletes we have won 3 Sussex titles, but just like the symbolic Phoenix bird that our club was named after the senior men&rsquo;s team has risen from the ashes of late to put the best group of athletes together for a generation. If the whole team turned up on the day the writing was going to be on the wall for the other teams going on the form shown in the County Cross Country relays where we had scored a record breaking win and even managed to get the B team into the medals. After the pre race Photo call 21 of the Phoenix team took to the start with all the Phoenix big dogs in the race this was going to be something special and it sure was. With the gun cracking loudly Jon Pepper moved straight to the front and swung around the first turn to attack the hill as if he was racing a 1500m rather than one of the toughest 12k cross country courses around, the chasing pack including Phoenix boys Ben Tickner, Ian Leitch, Finn Mcnally, Josh Guilmant were happy to sit back in the pack and see what Jon had got, knowing there would be time to make moves latter in the race. Going on to the second lap Ben moved into a chasing group with Matt Dumigan (Worthing) , Adam Clark (Hastings) and Todd Leckie (Hailsham) with Ian and Finn forming the next group of two and Josh further back taking a more steady approach to the race having had a difficult build up week. It was not long before Ben put his foot down and dropped Adam from the group with Todd going soon after. They were soon picked off with Josh moving past Finn and on to Ian shoulder, as Phoenix turned up the heat. Upfront Jon was setting the kind of pace that only the best in the country can stay with lucky for Ben he is in that  he was pulling him in. Jon however is not known for breaking or slowing in the final part of the race so it was up to Ben to increase the pace and he d, Ben was only a matter of seconds behind well clear of Matt coming in for Bronze. Ian and Josh were locked in their own private battle for 4th with Ian making a move with a 1 kilometre to go, not wanting to leave it to a final sprint with Josh (5th), to snatch 4th Finn was safely in 6th but was only 5th in the team given the amazing strength this year, a great run all the same given that this was his first year in the senior men's race. It was then left to Darryl Hards and Sam Wade to battle it out for the one remaining place in what would be the best gold medal team ever assembled by Phoenix. Darryl had been pushing the pace but it was Sam that made the final move powering down through the woods for 14th, to complete what is to be believed the second lowest score by any senior team in the history of the event which given its historical roots is massively significant.</p>\r\n<p>There was however to be a silver lining of sorts for Darryl as the B team were also chasing a medal of their own. Tom Hopkins may have been away from the track for some months but it looks like he has been doing some hard training, and also sporting a very impressive beard coming home in 18th. Dave Carter a cross country and marathon expert was returning after a lengthy spell on the s(31st), with James Atkinson 48th and Donald McClellan closing out team in 51st position. If ever it was worth pushing for every position this was the day to do it with the B team coming home just one point ahead of fourth and fifth place teams, to take the bronze medal. Well done to all the other guys including James Miles, Daren Elliott, Joe Francis, Malcolm Hughes, Brian Friend, Andy Neighbour, Stuart Pal, Ian Moss and Malcolm Kemp for taking part in Phoenix&rsquo;s greatest ever County Cross Country Team.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re going to win your first county title in 12 years you might as well do it in .</p>\r\n<p>Thank you to Malcolm Kemp for designing this especially tough but satisfying course and everyone who helped him set it out on the day. As well as all who supported the club on the day in one capacity or another, we could not run a club without having such a great group of indiv, giving up there time to make this happen.</p>\r\n<p>Photo Credit Lance Bellers<br />Photo Credit Quentin Davis (Under 13 boys team photo)</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sussexathletics.org.uk/results.php#304 \">Results</a></p>",

          "content": "<p>Earlier in January Jon Pepper and Ben Tickner scored a notable one/two running for the victorious Phoenix team in the county championships. Their good form continued in the South of England championships at Stanmer Park on 28 January. This time they ran in the colours of their first claim clubs, Wells AC (Tickner) ans Enfield and Haringay (Pepper). Ben it was who took the title, passing Phil Wicks of Belgrave Harriers in a thrilling sprint in the home stretch. Jon too was bearing down fast at the finish and took bronze medal. Other Phoenix members in action were Jose Luceron (133rd), James Miles (324th), Daren Elliot (347th) and Iain Martin (430th).<br /><br />The women fielded a scoring team (25th place) so well done to Cat Bounds (99th), Liz Durman (101st), Paule Kremer (157th) and Sonal Chaudhary (217th).<br /><br />There was a remarkable symmetry among the younger athletes with Finn McNally (U20), Will Durkin (U17) and Archie Davis (U13) all coming 13th in their age groups. That is superb running at this level. The U13 boys (Archie Davis, Harry Swindells, Ollie Johnson and Sam Betts) were also well placed as a team in 11th place.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.thepowerof10.info/results/results.aspx?meeting\">Full results</a></p>\r\n<p>Photos by Malcolm Kemp</p>",

Phoenix were represented by Charlotte Mathews(16<sup>th</sup>) and Claudia Betts(22<sup>th</sup>). This was the first time the girls hadn&rsquo;t managed to field a full team but despite this the team finished a very good 5<sup>th</sup> overall in the final league table. A special mention should go to Charlotte who ran in all four races, with Elorah and Claudia running in three.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p ><span ><span ><span >A report on the U13 boys has been prov......... </span>We went into the final league match at Lancing in gold medal position but on only 5 pts ahead of a strong Hastings team, who had closed the gap in the last match at Bexhill. With 4 potential A team runners absent, holding on to top spot was never going to be easy but as with last season the boys demonstrated the depth of quality in our squad at this level and still managed to field two full scoring teams. Archie Davis came home in 1<sup>st</sup> place ensuring him the indiv, Harry Bartley (7<sup>th</sup>) and Ollie Johnson (12<sup>th</sup>) ensured the gold medal spot by a slim 2pts from Hastings. The A team were backed up well by Sam Betts (21<sup>st</sup>), Joe Kelly (22<sup>nd</sup>) and Jack Etherton (29<sup>th</sup>), all running in their first season at this level and demonstrating how important it is to team spirit to hit that start line on mass, something the U13 boys have continued to do for the past two seasons and why they made a clean sweep of all the cross country gold medals at county level this season . Well done to everyone involved.... athletes, coaches and parents. </span></span></p>\r\n<p ><span ><span ></span></span></p>\r\n<p ><span ><span ><span >In the U15 girls race there were no Phoenix runners. A special mention though to Jody Mann who ran in all the other three league races.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p ><span ><span ><span >Billy White once again dominated the U15 boys race securing another win, with another fine effort by Will Russell in 27<sup>th</sup>. With Billy winning the three races he ran he also secured the indiv. With Will Russell and Sam Kitchen both also running three races each the team finished in 7<sup>th</sup> place in the final league table.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p ><span ><span ><span >William Thompson was the only Phoenix runner in the U17 boys race finishing in 6<sup>th</sup> place. Despite a lack of runners on the day the teams previous performances resulted in the team securing the bronze medals in the final league table.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p ><span ><span ><span >Several of the ladies runners were away or running the half marathon, however Phoenix still managed to field five runners. Unfortunately although Catherine Bounds was in contention for the indiv, however Erica Martin made up for her absence with a fine run finishing as first senior lady. She was followed by Lizzie Durman who is regaining her fitness and finished as 4<sup>th</sup> senior, Katheryne Harnett 10<sup>th</sup> senior, Liz Hal<sup>th</sup> veteran and Emma Hughes 13<sup>th</sup> senior. The team finished third on the day and third in the Div2 league, just missing out on promotion to Div1. A special mention for Paule Kremer who d<sup>th</sup> in the final league table. </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p ><span ><span ><span >The men&rsquo;s team were down on numbers but Max Pickard made up for this with a magnificent run to finish a clear first. Max followed James Baker until the start of the final lap where he broke away to finish 36 seconds clear. Max was followed by James Miles 24<sup>th</sup>, Nigel Herron 37<sup>th</sup> and Andrew Haig 79<sup>th</sup>. Despite being down on numbers enough points were gained by the senior men to finish in 6<sup>th</sup> place in the final league table securing their place in Div1. </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p ><span ><span ><span >Well done to all those athletes who have worn the Phoenix vest and competed in the x-country league races and a thank you to all the coaches, parents and partners who have supported the athletes.

          "content": "<p>The course starts and ends on grass via a narrow funnel. This results in a somewhat hazardous start, as runners look at their feet and try not to trip. By the end of the race, the grass had turned to mud and traction was very hard to find.</p>\r\n<p>The course itself has several significant features. The first of these is a kilometre-long steep uphill section at about the three mile mark, immediately followed by a correspondingly steep downhill back to sea-level. Other than this, the course is pretty flat. Perhaps because of this, runners attack the hill quite hard. It is tough.<br /> <br /> The second feature of the course is that a large part of it is an out-and-back on the seafront. Few Phoenix members will need reminding that seafront running more or less always means spending half your time running into a headwind. In a half marathon, that can be quite tough.<br /> <br /> The third feature of the course is that it has many, many sharp corners. The fourth feature is that these corners often involve rap, e.g., taking a right-angle to run from concrete onto a humped little metal br. This can be tough.<br /> <br /> One reason that there are so many corners is that the course route is extraordinarily intricate. On many occasions, impeccable marshalling is required to ensure that runners are sent in the right direction.<br /> <br /> The final and most important feature of Eastbourne Half Marathon this year is that the marshalling sadly fell far short of being impeccable. Several Phoenix runners had to repeatedly shout, &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; One had to stop when the answer was not given in time. At least two went the wrong way and covered extra distance. Daryl Hards was in third place when he was directed the wrong way, with the result that he ran an extra half-mile and ended up in 12th. That is beyond tough.<br /> <br /> It is always upsetting when one hears &ndash; far too frequently &ndash; about marshals and other volunteers being shabbily treated by ungrateful runners. Nevertheless, getting the distance (Brighton!) and directions (Eastbourne!) right surely have to be right up there among the things that need to be prioritised.<br /> <br /> With 1440 runners and the circumstances just described, Phoenix runners ran extremely well.<br /> <br /> The roll of honour:<br /> Daryl Hards (1:19:49, 12th)<br /> Andy Bone (1:24:46, 29th)<br /> Jon Pike (1:26:37, 35th)<br /> Tom Fars(1:26:41, 37th)<br /> Lance Bellars (1:32:59, 106th)<br /> Cat Bounds (1:38:51, 223rd)<br /> Terry Avey (1:38:58, 224th)</p>",

          "content": "<p><strong>Senior Men</strong></p>\r\n<p>Even before the senior men&rsquo;s race got underway, the anticipation was at fever pitch as to whether Phoenix would be entering their crack team for this event &ndash; not to disappoint the organisers and the other teams, we were!</p>\r\n<p>Before the race, it had been confirmed that Hastings AC had puttogethera very strong team that in most years would be right up there for the win. Brighton were also going to be as sol, having numbers on their s. However, Team Phoenix were in no mood to mess about, with a chance to take down the incredibly tough course record of 58:57 owned by the old-school Phoenix team that averaged just under 9.50 per leg when it was set 16 years ago. To put that into context, that&rsquo;s 5 seconds faster than the quickest overall leg last year run by Josh Guilmant. It was a mammoth task to take on.</p>\r\n<p>Opening up on leg one were Will Durkin (A team) and Sam Wade (B team). It was an incredibly tight call on who would get the nod between these two , with Will just shaving it. Running C teamfirst legwas Robbie Fitzgibbon (U17). As the gun sounded they headed off on the one large loop of the grounds of Christ Hospital School.First to reappear at the turn for the finish was Max Thomas of the Hastings club with Will just ahead of Sam, closing in times of 9.57 and 10.02. The tense head-to-head seemed to bring the most out of the them on the day, giving Will the top U17 time. He later confessed that he had had nightmares of Sam taking him on the line, having been given the A team spot. Sam&rsquo;s time was a massive 30 seconds faster than last year, and he is certainly the biggest improver in the team this year with his heavy triathlon training paying off.</p>\r\n<p>Taking over on second leg and 10 seconds down on Hastings was the reigning Southern Cross Country champion, Ben Tickner, and he was in no mood to do anything but hammer it, having got to the race some 3 hours before the start just to focus. As he set off it was like an animal being set loose from its cage and he started hunting down 1500m specialist Andrew Woods, going past him before he exiting the school grounds. If Ben was a dog he most probably would be half greyhound half husky, as he has the speed to go out fast and hunt down his prey and then just keep going in devastating fashion. As he came into the home straight he was determined to push all the way to the line, just as in any track race &ndash; an art lost on many road runners today. His time was a huge course record of 9:19 &ndash; smashing Phoenix old boy Steve Harris's 16-year-old mark of 9:27. The thoughts within the team when they heard what Ben had done were 'right now let&rsquo;s take down that team record'.</p>\r\n<p>Third up was Max Pickard, who has progressed massively over the winter, establishing himself as a more consistent performer at top county level over the cross country scene. Max would have wanted more, but 10.06 was good enough on the day. At this point the B team were making sound progress switching from 4th to 3th spot. Jose Luceron Munoz (10.36) and Jake Elliott &ndash; returning to form with10.29,the second fastest U17 time of the day &ndash; kept the team in the mix for the medals. Up until this point the C team had also been making steady progress; with a mix of youth and new members in the team, it was always going to be interesting to see how they fared. Robbie, having returned to form in training, ran a well-judged first leg to come home in 11.04. This was matched by Tobbias Bremer making his debut for the team with 11.11 &ndash; a very good run for someone who has never run the short distance before, and no doubt he will be looking for a strong summer season. Will Thompson was the surprise package of the day with no real form going into this race, it was going to be interesting to see what he could run. It turned out very well, with the 3rd fastest U17 time of the day: 10.49. An all Phoenix lock out of the U17 times.</p>\r\n<p>Back at the front of the race the A team were about to put the chasing teams further into the hurt locker, with Charlie Grice stepping into familiar territory. A m, he set off looking to improve on his 9.56 from last year and came home in a very impressive 9.41. At the age of 18, this looks likely to be revised further. Stalwart of the club James Miles running 4th leg for the B team gave a strong performance to hold the team in the bronze medal position with Hastings AC slipping out of the medals with their 3rd leg athlete taking a wrong turn on the course and disqualifying the whole team. Robin Fitzgibbon closed out the non-scoring C team in 11.22, setting himself up nicely for the marathon next week.</p>\r\n<p>Even without the pressure from Hastings, there was no letting up, as Josh Guilmant upped his game to deliver a .49. Darryl Hards (10.20) delivered the same kind of constitency for the B team that has led to bronze medals being picked up in the last two team races, extending the gap over the chasing Lewes team by a full minute.</p>\r\n<p>Last up Jon (Duracell Rabbit) Pepper, 'high on mileage' for his marathon preparations, stepped up to the plate to unleash some pent-up aggression from the previous week's Reading Half Marathon where he was sent the wrong way and lost out on a possible 64m clocking. Jon metronomically kicked out the pace to bring the team home in a massive course record of 58 27, some 30 seconds off the previous record. His was the second fastest time of the day: 9.35. Dan Stepneycomfortablybrought the Phoenix B team in for bronze, with Brighton taking second. With their best team for many years, they were still a massive 3 minutes adrift. Matt Bristow must be credited with putting together another strong Brighton team as he stands down as captain of his club after 10 years of service. Well done Matt.</p>\r\n<p>Not only were two course records broken in the senior race, but if you had taken the 6 fastest times from the other clubs and put them in one team they still would not have been within 1 minute of the time run by Team Phoenix. The question now is how long can this record last for? Success breeds success and the reason this record went in such dramatic .</p>\r\n<p><strong>Senior Women</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Senior women had a good day's work coming home 7th team. Paule Kremer, who has only been running competitively for a year, was given the task of leading the team out with a strong leg of 13.54 &ndash; quite different to the marathon and triathlon training she has been doing. Liz Durman showed she is getting back to fitness with 13 minutes flat, before Captain Erica Martin moved the team up with an impressive 12.20.</p>\r\n<p><strong>U13 Boys</strong></p>\r\n<p>Quenton once again put together the strongest team in Sussex, matching whatever the seniors were able to do, with another gold medal. There was a welcome return for Matt Berr.17. Max Winter and Joe Lillee both had good runs for the respective B and C teams on leg 1, showing that there is strength and depth in the squad, where they all can drive each other forward. Harry Swindells put in a sol, with Archie Davis showing Ben Tickner how it is done at U13 level &ndash; setting a fantastic course record of 5.46 to hold off a strong Lewes team by 8 seconds. The B team closed out in 8th place with Joe Kelly and Ollie Johnson matching Max&rsquo;s time. Jack Etherton and Charlie Warren also ran well for 14th place in the C team.</p>\r\n<p><strong>U13 Girls</strong></p>\r\n<p>It was great to see the U13 girls field a full team for these races and they d&ndash; just missing out on a medalby 8 seconds &ndash;with a 4th place finish. Elorah Mann 7.20, Naomi Fonteyn 6.59 and Almi Nerurkar 6.54 showed that with just a little more work, they will be a medal threat next time round. Well done too to the B team &ndash; Chloe Watson 7:04, Kate Grandlund 8:24 and Natasha Rodinguez 7:39.</p>\r\n<p><strong>U15 Girls</strong></p>\r\n<p>Jody Mann showed real determination and . With a late team drop out, she ran two legs. She opened with 7.23 before Sasha Clarke took over on leg two with 7.46. Jody then ran 8.03 for the last leg.</p>\r\n<p><strong>U15 Boys</strong></p>\r\n<p>The U15 boys had an outs. Will Russell ran leg one&ndash; quite a bit shorter than the Hove Park run he is used to &ndash;in 7.01. It was then up to Sam Kitchen to move through the field to try and set Billy White up so that he would be in striking range of the medals. Billy this year has been on fire in the county and even though they were down in 7th place they still had a shot. The number of athletes Billy had to pass must have helped, as not only d.16!</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Masters</strong></p>\r\n<p>Phoenix men vets have strength in depth at the moment and full teams were entered in each age category. They were rewarded with silver medals for the O60s, bronze for the O50s and an excellent fourth place for the O40s.<br /><br />The 60s and 50s ran first. O60s were defending champions and fielded the same team as last year: Malcolm Kemp (13:08), Terry Avey (13:04) and Andrew Field (12:59) all improved their times significantly for second place behind a full strength Brighton &amp; Hove team.<br /><br />Bob Novis (11:58), Phil Hampshire (11:56) and Malcolm Hughes (12:18) deservedly won bronze in the O50 category. The B team (including two 66 year-olds &ndash; Andrew Haig and Rik Taub &ndash; and youngster Steve Webb) were delighted not to come last!<br /><br />The O40s were rewarded with 4th and 6th spots, a clear indication of how strong we are in that age group. Bruce Warren kicked of with a powerful 11:25 for the A team followed by Daren Elliot (11:47), John Marinko (12:11) and Dav(12:06). The B team were also pretty consistent &ndash; Nigel Herron led off in 12:06, handing over to Stuart Pal (12:54), Lance Bellers (12:33) and Ray Matthews (12:03).</p>\r\n<p>The women vet's team unfortunately had elected to run in the senior race, placing 14th. Had they been able to run in their own respective race they would have finished 4th. Anita Jones, Carol Webb and Liz Hall. It would have been interesting to see what they would of done had they run in the vets' race. Maybe a medal could have been snatched.</p>",

While Jon had a slightly more frustrating race build up at Reading where he was sent over 1 kilometre off course missing out on a possible 64m clocking even so the fitness was there for the big day.</p>\r\n<p>The conditions for London were a little hot and there was a stiff breeze in the second half of the race. Both set off at a fast pace always looking to push their limits to the maximum, pure racing hounds. At halfway the clock read 68.41 (Jon) 69.59 (Ian) and were on course, however as they neared the 20 mile mark they were both well and truly in the hurt locker with no way out but to finish.

I think I may have been a bit ambitious with my time as Malcolm and Alex went off only just after me.<br />I got a bit carried away sprinting to T1 and slipped over before getting there! I d't lose too much time doing this and luckily no one saw!<br /><br />I went out hard on the bike and enjoyed the route. Malcolm came past me halfway round the second lap but he soon disappeared up the road. I also got caught by the traffic lights each time. The final time I think I lost about 45 seconds but theres nothing you can do about it.<br /><br />I felt good going out on the run and managed to push hard all the way as it was only 3.5km.<br />I was really pleased with coming second and would definately do this race again.<br /><br />Well done to Katie who was competing in her first triathlon. Also well done to Paule and Liz who finished 4th and 5th respectively. Liz would have been first vet but unfortunately they only count over 50s in this race.<br />Alex and Malcolm both d.<br />_________________</span></p>",

He was a real fighter and one of the fittest guys I knew. Even while battling the cancer over the years, I would still see him out enjoying the quiet tranquility that running over the South Downs brought him.<br /><br />I remember Bruce being quite shy when he joined the club, but as soon as he realised he was in like-minded company, he embraced it to the full, sharing his passion with his children who also joined and ran for the club. Taking up competitive running as a veteran, most of his best races came over the tough country that he trained on. He excelled at battling tough courses as well as the competition, but for Bruce running was far more about the natural environment that he could immerse himself in.<br /><br />All who knew him at Phoenix will miss him; my thoughts are with his family.</em><br /><br /><strong>Josh Guilmant</strong><br />Club Captain<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>I d&rsquo;t know Bruce very well, but I d.<br /><br />He was a mild-mannered chap and it was always a pleasure to share a start line with him or the odd pint in the pub at the club Thursday night socials.<br /><br />I was awestruck with his running ability, especially cross country. It d&rsquo;t matter whether it was up or down, Bruce took them on, and it d&rsquo;t matter what his illness threw at him &ndash; he seemed to take it in his str. I remember running through Withdean Woods one evening and a lone figure was walking up the hill. It was Bruce and he was following his doctor&rsquo;s orders: a short walk - this after major surgery only a couple of days before.<br /><br />He was a phenomenal runner, winning a couple of local marathons as well as the Phoenix Veterans Award on more than one occasion. Only last year he ran a 38-minute Phoenix 10k &ndash; no mean feat for a man in palliative care.<br /><br />Bruce was a gentleman and the Club will miss him immensely. My thoughts go to his family.<br /></em><br /><strong>Andy Bone</strong><br /><br /><br /><em><br />I well remember racing against Bruce some years back. He was tough and tenacious and pretty quick too! Only after racing him d. I couldn&rsquo;t believe how well he ran with all he had to deal with. Bruce was quite simply inspirational. Bruce was an important figure within our club and he will be sorely missed. All our thoughts go to his family.</em><br /><br /><strong>Paul Collicutt</strong></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em>I d, but I knew him as a runner and there's a special kind of knowledge and bond in that. Simon Barnes writes for the Times, he says 'sport doesn't build character, it reveals it'. And running reveals it in special ways. Bruce was an honest, kind, competitive and gracious guy. I know all of that as a fact because I ran with him, I raced with him, and I spoke to him immediately after one 'Jack and Jill' where he had beaten me by 3 full minutes! The image I have of him now is of meeting him on the path from the Foredown Tower to Devils Dyke, he was running down, I was running up. We stopped, he had already had major treatment and was coming back to form. We spoke for exactly 1 minute, then he sa! One minute of Bruce's time, m, the right balance of friendship and competitiveness. My heart aches that he will never get to challenge that PB again, I know he would have loved another crack at it!</em><br /><br /><strong>Mike Townley</strong></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The Funeral service will be held at Woodvale Crematorium, South Chapel on  Wednesday, 30th   May at 10.30 a.m. Family flowers only please but donations if desired  may be made payable to Macmillan Nurses or the Martlets Hospice c/o  Co-operative Funeralcare, 133 London Road, Brighton, BN1   4JH.

The race was a sprint cross triathlon with a 500m swim, 10k mountain bike and a 5 k trail run. The mountain bike route was a hilly, technical course, with lots of narrow forest tracks, boulders, jumps, br. The run used most of the bike course, then turned towards a boggy lakes.<br /><br />I hired a mountain bike from a local shop which saved me at least a hundred pounds and the hassle of getting my bike to the USA.<br /><br />There were only two paras who turned up to race, (me Para Tri 3 category) and an (Para Tri 5 category) American, so we had plenty of room and congratulated each other for winning our category before we started. It was a shame that the Americans d, especially as I believe there were over 40 who raced in their nationals a week later (so d)<br /><br />Race went according to plan in over 30 degree heat, I had a decent swim and no alligators in site, negotiated the mountain bike course slowly, I had to dismount to get over a few of the obstacles, and ran the full 5 k trail route. Came in just over the two hour mark, which I was pleased with. My daughter Grace came with me to support and help me in transition.<br /><br />Awards ceremony went well except that the organisers thought there was only on para race instead of there being two separate para tri categories, so was awarded a silver, gold will be sent to me.<br /><br />Had a great 8 days in the USA, went to a baseball match, a theme park in Atlanta, shopped to I dropped and ate too much<br /><br /><br />Time Swim  T1 Bike  T2 Run<br />02:03:17 00:13:47  00:03:09 00:57:24 00:01:31 00:47:24</p>",

This means that each person runs three of the 18 legs with an average distance of 5.5 miles per leg. It's all very tactical and logistical and it's a rare team that doesn't go off course at some point in the day. Phoenix were no exception with the women taking a diversion on the very first leg and the vets waiting until leg 17 before exploring the surrounding countrys. Both managed to rectify the situation brilliantly with the vets taking silver in a hard-fought category.<br /><br />2 senior records went (Ok one was for the new leg 15 now held by Stuart) and I think we only had two seniors running! 5 women's records went with some exceptional performances from Cat and Erica And a whopping 9 vet men's records went across the 3 teams</p>\r\n<p>Pr...and he wasn&rsquo;t even in the vets team! The most spectacular record was Phil Hampshire's on leg 12. Locked in a battle with Any Bone and Erica Martin at that stage, he managed to break his own record from 1999! The vets team also cracked the best overall time achieved by a vet's team since 2000.<br /><br />We all placed well in our categories and also in the Cooper Cup (Age related/time ratio)<br /><br />Special thanks to the drivers Petra, Miles, Sue and Roland who were on duty from dawn till late at night and d. Thanks to Andy Bone and Liz Hall, Liz, Malcolm and Lance. Thanks also to Lance for the great shots (+one from Katie &ndash; guess which).<br /><br />See <a href=\"../../../results\">results</a> for more detail and stats.</p>",

His team mates in the South Downs Way relay at the beginning of June found that hard enough but for Brian it was just a light-weight training session leading up to this, the real challenge. The annual indiv'Centurian' 100M event attracts its full complement of 200 runners with roughly two thirds completing the task. Starting over in Winchester at 6am on the Saturday, Brian was hoping to be not too far over the 20 hour mark. In fact he finished in an impressive 21:43:47 and in 14th place.</p>\r\n<p>We caught up with him at Devils Dyke after 13 hours of running and as you can see from the photographs he was still all smiles. He had been paced through some of this section by Elana Moore and Matt Plass as well as his young nephew Tom Jupp. Later that night he was met by Tom Fars, running by head torch. (Tom got just a couple of hours rest at home before heading off to the Bewl 15M where he ran a fine pb!)</p>\r\n<p>Congratulations Brian.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.centurionrunning.com/live\">Full results</a></p>",

Steve Ovett (mark two) is not only a better likeness of the joint Phoenix Club founder but is somewhat taller sitting on a 5 foot plinth at the finish line to the Brighton Marathon on Madeira Drive. All who now run along the seafront can have the honour of passing Steve a task that would have been somewhat harder when in his prime. Steve was joined by his family who have also flown in for the Olympics and members of the club past and present.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-18971752\">BBC article hear</a></p>",

          "content": "<p>With the passing of club member Bruce Falkner a few months ago the club was dec, a wave of applause broke out. It was a happy sight to see Bruce&rsquo;s family attending the race as well as twin brother Shane who chose to run it with a very impressive time of 38.45. <br /><br />After the perfectly calm weather that runners were treated to on the first running of the Phoenix 10K the weather gods chose not to be so generous with what felt like gale force winds meeting the runners for what would normally be perfect summer conditions for a evening race.</p>\r\n<p><br />The race was once again a sell out and looks to be progressing well in only its second year. Taking the win this year was Kenyan athlete John Kales but like last year it was only by the smallest of margins beating reigning Southern Cross Country Champion Ben Tickner by 4 seconds to come home in 30.55. With the stiff wind hitting the runners for the first 5k it made record chasing hard going and John who works as a professional pacer at some of the leading world marathons came up short by some 25 odd seconds although it was rumoured that his second half of the race was run in 13.50!! Unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have the exact splits. John will be hoping to make his full Marathon debut next year and will be looking to run in the 2.08 region. Filling the top three on the men&rsquo;s s.</p>\r\n<p><br />The women&rsquo;s race turned out to be a fine race with Cassie Thorp of City of Portsmouth getting the better of some of the top Sussex runners, Rebecca Moore and Fiona Clark. Cassie has been in great shape this summer putting down a 34.27 10k and even with the poor conditions she powered away with a very impressive second half of the race to break the course record in 35.49. Rebecca also used the tail wind to pass Fiona to grab the second place in 36.52 to 37.15.</p>\r\n<p><br />There was a huge turnout from the club with 31 athletes running top finisher were the already mentioned Ben Tickner and Cat Bounds. Full club results below.</p>\r\n<p><br />A massive thank you must go Andy Bone&rsquo;s way in carrying the Phoenix 10K forward as race director, also a big thank you to Liz Hall. As well as all the volunteers who played their part as there is no way this race could go ahead without them. The cheering at the turn by Carats Caf&eacute; from John Marinko and his team of the younger members of the club was appreciated by all the runners.</p>\r\n<p><br />Thank you to Geneva Investment Group, Shoreham Port Authority, Fr, Brighton and Hove Council and Kate at the Clocktower Sanctuary.</p>\r\n<p>Photos can be found on the Facebook page hear<br /><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/brightonphoenix10k\"><br />http://www.facebook.com/brightonphoenix10k</a></p>\r\n<p><br />2 Ben Tickner 0:30:59 <br />8 Tom Hopkins 0:33:41<br />17 Finn McNally 0:35:36 <br />24 Tobias Bremer 0:36:35<br />31 Wes Mechen 0:37:02<br />47 Ray Matthews 0:38:31<br />50 Tom Fars<br />51 Donald MacLellan 0:38:47<br />55 Samuel Miles 0:39:01<br />59 Daren Elliott 0:39:16<br />62 Nigel Herron 0:39:26<br />66 Mal Burden 0:40:06<br />67 Lance Bellers 0:40:09<br />71 Paul Wishart 0:40:41 <br />76 Tom Holborn 0:40:37<br />85 Paul Lawrence 0:40:57<br />88 Iain Martin 0:40:50<br />107 Terry Avey 0:41:57 (1st M60)<br />116 Andrew Haig 0:42:23<br />130 Stuart Pal 0:42:53<br />137 Cat Bounds 0:43:04<br />174 John Donno 0:44:17<br />202 Paule Kremer 0:45:32<br />211 Gill Checkley 0:46:08<br />212 Richard Woodward 0:46:08<br />241 Sonal Chaudhary 0:47:01<br />242 Michelle Cartwright 0:47:03<br />254 Kathryn Harnett 0:47:37<br />267 Jason Thompson 0:48:11<br />309 Katie Hall 0:50:55<br />350 Lucinda Ganpatsingh 0:54:25</p>",

Josh Guilmant had the task of leading the team off, in what could only be described as monsoon like conditions, with parts of the course having puddles that resembled lakes &ndash; a far cry from the sunny conditions that the juniors were treated to on the Saturday. Josh came home in 13th position, managing to out-dip his less-than-fit training partner Ben Tickner (18.52) running for his first claim club. Dan Stepney took over on second leg, to put in one of his best performances over the Aldershot course, as he looks to build a strong base for the season. Dave Carter made a welcome return to the team, after last competing in the Sussex Champs back in January. He showed that he has lost none of his strength, with a sol. Ian Leitch then cut loose, to run a cracking 19.01 and move the team up 10 places. This after being out all summer with a foot injury.

Almi Nerukar then took up the running on the final leg to power home in the fastest time of the day and secure a marvellous team gold. To think this team was only put together a few days beforehand.

The men's race was won by Paul Martelletti in 30 minutes dead and the women's race by Caryl Jones in 32:31 &ndash; a new course record.</p>\r\n<p>13 Josh Guilmant 00:31:55<br />21 Darryl Hards 00:33:07<br />42 Pat Daveron 00:34:25 <br />44 James Miles 00:34:37<br />75 James Atkinson 00:35:38<br />82 Bruce Warren 00:36:02 (2nd M50)<br />102 Jon Pike 00:36:50<br />103 Donald Maclellan 00:36:55 PB<br />129 Iain Martin 00:37:51<br />149 Nigel Herron 00:38:10<br />167 Paul Lawrence 00:38:46<br />184 Lance Bellers 00:38:59<br />206 Jim Whitelegg 00:39:45<br />231 Mark Mergler 00:39:45<br />236 Andrew Neighbour 00:39:47<br />249 Malcolm Hughes 00:40:02<br />289 Terry Avey 00:40:45 (1st M60)<br />317 Tom Sanderson 00:41:04<br />328 Andrew Haig 00:41:27 (2nd M60)<br />337 Elizabeth Durman 00:41:40<br />360 Charlotte Softly 00:41:41<br />414 Roland Harrington 00:42:40<br />488 Johnathan Donno 00:43:36<br />599 Jon Moon 00:43:34<br />788 Malcolm Kemp 00:47:06<br />900 Steven Johnson 00:47:48<br />1084 Lee McGeever 00:49:43<br />2715 Paul Thomas 01:18:23</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>STOPPRESS</p>\r\n<p>County medals are now confirmed. Brighton Phoenix  were bronze  medalists in the team competition (Guilmant, Miles,  Atkinson).

          "content": "<div><strong>Senior Men</strong></div>\r\n<div><strong><br /></strong></div>\r\n<div>Going into the 2013 Sussex Cross Country Championship, Phoenix senior men had never retained the title. To do so would be to create a little bit of club history and make Phoenix only the third club in the championship's long history to retain the title. Jon Pepper was also chasing the indiv.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The Phoenix team on paper going into this race was loaded not just at the front end but all the way down the field. We may only have a small team but when we turn up for the same race it&rsquo;s pretty special. So to say we were the favourites was clearly obvious to the other teams. However being the favourite&rsquo;s means nothing if you can&rsquo;t all get to the start line and back it up on the day. So with the gun cracking we were off on 7.5 miles of the legendary Stanmer Park course.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>Jon wasted no time going to the front of the pack on a mission to break Adam Clark (Hastings) who was w. However the Stanmer course does not take any prisoners and usually prov&rsquo;s and it was not long before Jon was out alone stamping his authority on the race.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The fight in the chasing pack was concentrated now on Adam and the Phoenix big dogs Ben Tickner and Ian Leitch all vying to be in the medals. Further down the field Josh Guilmant, Sam Wade and Darryl Hards were filling the three remaining spots in the 6-man scoring A team with only one runner from main rivals Brighton and Hove splitting the 6. The writing looked like it was already on the wall!</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>The B team were also fighting hard to retain their bronze medal that had been so fantastically won the previous year, but they had some tough competition as both Lewes and Worthing had brought their best possible teams to the races.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>As the raced moved on to the last of the three laps Jon was still keeping the pace cranked up to maximum volume with Ben making a late charge to see if he could run him down &ndash; something he so famously d. Ian Leitch was making the most of some coinc. However Adam was not completely gone and on the downhill home straight he unleashed his 1500m speed to try and claw Ian in. It was not enough though as Ian put himself well and truly in the hurt locker to claim Bronze. Just moments before Jon had secured an amazing double indiv, who must be feeling like Sileshi Sihine (the silver man!)</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>Last year joint club founders Matt Paterson and Steve Ovett were informed about the successes the team had in securing a 1,2 finish and the second lowest score in the championships history. Both were incredibly happy that the club had done so well. However Steve jokingly asked why we had not managed to nab all three indiv. Well just for you Steve, the guys raised their game with an all-Phoenix medal lock out! Booom! </div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>At this point there was still a team title to win and Sam who has been making waves in triathlon this summer, also stepped up his game in cross-country with a fine 8th place. Josh fired down the last hill to take 10th with Darryl coming home in 12th a big performance after having so many years out of the game. This capped off a 36 points total and with no other team in sight of such a low score. Brighton and Hove AC came in second but the question was could Team Phoenix get third spot. Tom Hopkins, as he d, led the B team in 23rd spot, with Dave Carter just a few places back in 26th position. What was so remarkable about Dave&rsquo;s run was that he had fallen on the sharp turn coming out of the woods and latter found out he was running on a broken ankle. The Stammer course maybe tough and unforgiving but Phoenix has athletes to match it. We wish Dave a speedy recovery. New boy Kevin Gadd, like a tattooed warrior, took a great 30th and will be looking to build the fitness as he battles with the marathon once again this year. Coming in, in unison, Tobias Bremer (38), James Miles (39) and, battle scarred from another nasty fall, Bruce Warren (40) closed out the B team. The points were close but in the end the B team had to settle for 5th. Still a great result when consthe three teams ahead clearly brought their best teams to the show and then only narrowly took the spoils.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>Donald MaClean (43rd) another faller and James Atkinson (45th) just missed out on a B team spot, but nonetheless took the Phoenix fighting spirit to the opposition, and this was echoed all the way down the team.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>Adam Tribe (50)</div>\r\n<div>Wez Mechen (60)</div>\r\n<div>Nigel Herron (70)</div>\r\n<div>Iain Martin (75)</div>\r\n<div>Andy Neighbour (85)</div>\r\n<div>Stuart Pal (86)</div>\r\n<div>Jim Whitelegg (87)</div>\r\n<div>Lance Bellers (89)</div>\r\n<div>Ashley Guest (90)</div>\r\n<div>Ray Matthews (93)</div>\r\n<div>Andrew Haig (104)</div>\r\n<div>Tom Fars(105)</div>\r\n<div>Brian Friend (109)</div>\r\n<div>Malcolm Hughes (110)</div>\r\n<div>Malcolm Kemp (121)</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div>This capped off A, B, C, D and E teams for Phoenix, 1/4 of the entire field. That&rsquo;s how to bring it to a championship race &ndash; an amazing team spirit from all involved. This also shows the strength of having a joint Running and Tri set up where we can pull our resources and show why we are the best cross-country team in Sussex. A special thanks you to Vice Captain Darryl Hardes for organising the team</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div><strong>Senior Women, U20 women</strong></div>\r\n<div>It was 6th place for the women this year as they continue rebuilding the team, led home by Captain Erica Martin in an impressive 12th place, with Megan Bradford backing her up in 22nd (7th U20). This was a strong run from Megan seeing that she is still learning the craft of cross-country running. Liz Durman 30th and Paule Kremer 35th came in tightly packed to close out the A team with Rachel Phelps 52nd making a welcome return to running after some time out. Liz Hall, Hildi Mitchell 63rd, Deb Friis 67th, Lesley Fairbairn 79th and Melanie Newport 81st closed out the Phoenix line up.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div><strong>U20 Men</strong></div>\r\n<div>Only one runner in this race &ndash; Will Durkin. But Will does not need team mates to be in the mix, and he was a strong silver medal winner in his first year as an U20. He will be hoping to go one better next year, but all attention will turn to the summer season where Will is due a breakthrough on the track.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div><strong>U17 Men</strong></div>\r\n<div>This was a cracking race indiv, Robbie Fitzgibbon lead the charge for the title but found Harry Leleu (Chichester)just a little bit to good on this occasion although with his increased training regime he will soon feel the benefits come the summer season. Spencer Thomas, another athlete new to cross county and coming from a cycling background, had his best run of the season to finish 5th and secure his place for the inter-counties latter in March. Sam Kitchen, always up for a scrap, managed to split the Chichester runners with a 7th place finish to prov&ndash; 14 to 15 against Chichester. Well done guys!</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div><strong>U15 Boys</strong></div>\r\n<div>Archie Davis, back from long-term injury, had a fine run to snatch a bronze medal in the U15&rsquo;s and will be looking for other positive results come the inter-counties and schools races later in the season. Chris Mcgarry and Will Russell closed out the team but on this occasion were not in the medals.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div><strong>U15 Girls</strong></div>\r\n<div>Natacha Rodrigues was the sole competitor with a creditable 13th place finish.</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div><strong>U13 Boys</strong></div>\r\n<div>The U13 boys d, but in this age group it is very much about learning the craft of cross-country running and enjoying the day. Well done to Jake Etherton 24th, Jake Mathieson 33rd, Francis Barker 41st, and Cameron Hardman 46th</div>\r\n<div><br /></div>\r\n<div><strong>U13 Girls</strong></div>\r\n<div>The U13&rsquo;s girls had a fantastic team victory. Almi Nerukar and Naomi Fonteyn have been battling it out all season and it was close again, with Almi taking the title and only Hannah Cook (Hastings) able to split the two, with Naomi coming in for the bronze. Charlotte Mathews was a strong sixth to close out the team. The really positive thing in this age group is that there is a group of girls all training and working together, and the first scoring three were backed up by Chloe Watson 8th, Ellia Grabsky 33rd, Lola Evans 39th, Isabel WhiteLegg 40th and Louisa Sanders 41st</div>",

          "content": "<p>Just off the plane from training in Kenya Charlie was straight into the Euro trials race on a very muddy Liverpool course. After having some time off to adjust to university life he was not sure if he had, had enough time to train in Kenya to make the British team for the European Championships, after so narrowly missing the team last year. This was made even harder when he saw the course, his least favourite surface sticky mud! However this was one year on and Charlie has grown in strength. He set off conservatively sitting in the pack and weighting to make his move in the closing stages. Doing just this he moved though the field to come away with a fantastic 2nd place to book his place in the team and gain his first Cross County GB vest. Also in action and making the long trip up north was Finn McNally (U23) 29th and Robbie Fitzgibbon (U17) 41st.</p>\r\n<p>From the thick mud of Liverpool Charlie was thrown into the arctic freezer of Hungary, where a hard snowy course greeted him. Traditional the British team normally do very well in these championships and this was no different for Charlie as he went with the pace from the gun knowing that with the fast underfoot conditions it would be hard to make up the ground latter in the race. Digging deep in the last 2k he came away with a very (2nd Brit) and Euro team Bronze, not bad for someone who feels more comfortable over 4 laps of the track.

          "content": "<p>While Charlie Grice was achieving his stunning 3rd place at the UK European Trials in Sheffield (3:48:34) the Masters and school age Phoenix athletes were off to the muddy slopes of Bexhill Down for the postponed County Champs. It was to prove a highly successful day for the club.<br /><br /><strong>MASTERS CHAMPS</strong><br />The postponement of the event meant that our entries had been halved come the day and judging by the small fields in all age groups, most clubs had suffered the same drop off. Such is the strength in depth of Phoenix that we still managed to field fifteen runners with full scoring teams across the age bands for the men and one joint team for the women's race. We were rewarded with our best medal result in years, the O60s, O50s and O40s men all taking team silver.<br /><br /><strong>O40 Men 9,800M</strong><br />The race was won by the irrepressible Robbie James of Lewes in 35:55. <strong>Donald Maclellan</strong> was first Phoenix man in 6th place (38:15). Great performance by Donald. With <strong>Andy Bone</strong> 18th, <strong>Nigel Herron</strong> 19th and <strong>Miles Dav</strong> 22nd proving once again that good bunching pays off in cross-country, we took silver behind an excellent Crawley team. <strong>Jonathan Lamb</strong> backed up the scoring quartet with a creditable 30th.<br /><br /><strong>O50 Men 9,800M</strong> <br />The race was won in 38:46 by Viesters Dude of Crawley who again took team gold. Phoenix's <strong>Bruce Warren</strong> ran a blinder for indiv(39:30) and led the way for another team silver just four points behind Crawley. Mind you it was a close run thing with Horsham breathing down our necks and just three points behind. Brave runs by <strong>Mike Townley</strong> 7th and <strong>Malcolm Hughes</strong> 13th ensured we held our place.<br /><br /><strong>O60 men 7440M</strong><br />Run of the day was by <strong>Malcolm Kemp</strong> who came 6th in 37:25 taking some notable scalps along the way. Some indication of his form is that he was a mere 30 seconds behind the great Barry Blackwell of B&amp;H. Brighton took team gold with the invincible Pete Witcombe winning in 34:49. <strong>Terry Avey</strong> 10th and <strong>Andrew Haig</strong> 11th rounded out the Phoenix team with <strong>Rik Taub</strong> 20th giving stirling support. Silver team medal again.<br /><br /><strong>O35 women 6400M</strong><br />The women (otherwise eligible for different age groups) opted to pool their resources in this one age group and, though last scoring team, were not that far out of the loop. Certainly they seemed to be enjoying the event enormously and how about this for bunching &ndash; 24th <strong>Hildi Mitchell</strong>, 25th <strong>Liz Hall</strong>, 26th <strong>Kathryn Harnet</strong>. The race was won by Fay Cripps of Chichester in 27:45.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to Lance Bellers for the photos<br /><br /><strong>SCHOOLS CHAMPS</strong><br />A glance at the schools results &ndash; although not a club event, shows Phoenix athletes taking a disproportionate share of the honours. <strong>Archie Davis</strong> (Patcham) won the junior boys event by a convincing margin. <strong>Harry Swindells</strong> (Lewes Old Grammar) 17th, and <strong>Jack Etherton</strong> (Patcham) 27th, were other club memberrs we spotted. It was first and second for <strong>Billy White</strong> (Patcham) and <strong>Jake Alger</strong> ( Seaford Head) in the intermediate boys race. The senior race repeated the result with <strong>Will Durkin</strong> (Ardingly) taking the honours just 10 seconds ahead of clubmate <strong>Robbie Fitzgibbon</strong> (BHASVIC).<br /><br /><strong>Chloe Watson</strong> (Varndean) 5th and <strong>Charlotte Matthews</strong> (CNCS) 6th were just seconds outs. <strong>Ella Grabsky</strong> (Brighton College) also ran well for 24th place.</p>",

Jon Pepper,  now running first claim for Phoenix was the other star of the day coming  4th in the senior men's race.</p>\r\n<p>The scoring quartet for the U17 boys was:<br /><strong>Robbie Fitzgibbon</strong> 7th<br /><strong>Billy White</strong> 19th<br /><strong>Jake Alger</strong> 31st<br /><strong>Spencer Thomas</strong> 48th<br /><br /><strong>Sam Kitchen</strong> used his 400m speed to hit the front early and sustained the<br />lead for the first kilometre. Although he never expected to maintain a high<br />position he would have expected to be higher than his placing of 112th but<br />he sustained two falls in quick succession and showed real determination to<br />complete the race. (see photo at bottom of page)<br /><br />The U13 Girls team were placed a creditable 10th with all our runners<br />competing at this event for the first time.<br /><strong>Almi Nerurkar</strong> 29th<br /><strong>Naomi Fonteyn</strong> 59th<br /><strong>Charlotte Matthews</strong> 78th<br /><strong>Chloe Watson</strong> 79th<br /><br />The U15 Boys only managed to field two runners:<br /><strong>Archie Davis</strong> 22nd<br /><strong>Ollie Johnson</strong> 150th<br />Both boys are at the bottom end of the age group, so impressive runs by them.<br /><br /><strong>Megan Bradford</strong> was our only runner in the U20 Womens race and she had a fine run<br />to come in 39th place.</p>\r\n<p>In the senior races, the date change again meant some drop outs from club representation but there were some terrific results.<br /><br />Last year <strong>Jon Pepper</strong> came third in this event running for his then first claim club. Having switched his allegiance to Phoenix he ran superb race in the white vest to take fourth spot in 50:07. There is a further link with the club in that the race was won by Frank Tickner, brother of Phoenix second claim runner Ben. His time was 48:10. <strong>Stuart Pal</strong> was the only other Phoenix SM. He ran a very respectable 69:54 in 323rd place.<br /><br />In the senior women's race both runners scored in the top hundred &ndash; no mean feat in this context. <strong>Erica Martin</strong> was 56th in 35:19 and <strong>Paule Kremer</strong> 94thin 37:54. The race was won in 28:57.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thepowerof10.info/results/results.aspx?meeting\">Full results</a></p>",

In an exciting final race <strong>Almi Nerurakar</strong> took the win with <strong>Chloe Watson</strong> 7th, <strong>Louisa Saunders</strong> 22nd <strong>Claudia Betts</strong> 26th and <strong>Izzie Whitelegg</strong> 30th to clinch a fantastic team Gold. We were three girls down both Naomi and Charlotte were away and Ateya not well. It was hugely exciting season which was capped off with <strong>Almi</strong> <strong>Nerurakar</strong> winning indiv<strong>Naomi Fontyn</strong> taking the bronze. Thank you to everyone who raced and helped the team through the season.<br /><em>Roy Hayward</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Under 13 boys</strong><em><br /></em>With just <strong>Zachery Ebourne</strong> representing Phoenix at Lancing, this group were down at 11th place for the season. Well done to Zachery.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Under 15 boys</strong><em><br /></em>There has been no girls team throughout the season but the ever reliable <strong>Will Russell</strong> and <strong>Christopher McGarry</strong> competed and the team ended with a creditable fourth spot.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Under 17 men</strong><em><br /></em>It was a terrific season from this group too and although there were just two racing at Lancing &ndash; <strong>Jake Alger</strong> winning, with <strong>Sam Kitchen</strong> 5th &ndash; this was enough for them to win team gold. Jake won indiv.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Under 17, under 20, senior and vet women</strong><em><br /></em>Just three runners on the day but congratulations go to <strong>Megan Bradford</strong>, <strong>Liz Hall</strong> and <strong>Lesley Fairbairn</strong> for maintaing second overall position for the women's team which means promotion to division 1 next season. <strong>Liz Durman</strong>, <strong>Anita Jones</strong>, <strong>Paule Kremer</strong> and <strong>Erica Martin</strong> helped set up the success in earlier races. The vet team scored 11th overall.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Senior and vet men<br /></strong>Against all the odds &ndash; there was only one senior running (a fine 6th place by <strong>Daryl Hards</strong>) &ndash; the seniors managed to finish in silver position for the season thanks as ever to the vets making up the team. On this occasion <strong>Nigel Heron, Andy Bone, Daren Elliot, Jim Whitelegg</strong> and <strong>Lance Bellers</strong> were the saviours. Ironically, such is the quality of vet running in the county, this was only sufficient for bronze place in the vets competition. Phoenix vet B were 9th out of the 20 scoring teams.</p>\r\n<p></p>",

The annual event sees teams of 6 running 3 gruelling legs each of between 4 and 8 miles. Covering a total of 95 miles from Beachy Head, near Eastbourne,  to Chilcomb, Winchester this race tests even the toughest resolve.</p>\r\n<p >The race has separate categories for A teams, B teams, Vets teams and Women's teams. The Phoenix A team (seniors) and B team both won gold and the men's vets team won silver. The women were in bronze position.The reports below are sent from the runners:</p>\r\n<p>It was another good SDW relay day good conditions although the NNW wind made some bits quite hard, particularly on the early legs. This being an odd numbered year, 2013, the course was over the tougher Seven Sisters route. The team achieved its best time to date over this harder of the two routes. Two new Brighton Phoenix Ladies records were achieved, these were by <strong>Liz Durman</strong> on leg 1 and <strong>Paule Kremer </strong>on leg12. All ran close to or better than the predicted times I had set and we finished 5:11 quicker than our total predicted time.<br />Our overall time was 13:39:49 - 3rd overall.<br />Our senior men made an A team in all respects that produced fast running and a fast driver to win the overall and the A team competition - very impressive and next year they'll go for the record.<br /><br />Our B team also took gold in the B Team competition.<br />Our vet men won silver the Vet Team competition.<br />A great turnout with a very good showing from our club - well done all.<br />Best wishes and Happy Running to all<br />Liz Hall</p>\r\n<p><strong>Malcolm</strong> has raced well over a dozen South Downs Way relays but his hunger for it never seems to diminish. We had a sweepstake in our van based on estimates for each leg and Malcolm walked away with the thirty qu, beating us all by (literally) a country mile. Not bad for a sixty-something. <strong>Jim</strong> gave us a good start on the stunning but murderous ups and downs of the Seven Sisters and completed a tough trio with legs 7 and 13. He also had to contend with the realisation that he would be sharing his third leg with <strong>Ben</strong> and <strong>Don</strong>! <strong>Andrew</strong> had an even tougher set, including the long 17, and held the team together superbly. <strong>John</strong> enjoyed a fine debut and <strong>Phil</strong> was reliable as ever, wrapping up with a strong leg 18 (and definitely finished with the cleanest teeth). I struggled through most of the day but was pleased to see off Butser hill and make it to the end of my three legs. We were naturally delighted to discover that we had won gold in the B team category. Arena 80 were our main rivals and it turned out we had pipped them by three minutes, even though we had not seen them at all as they had set off an hour after us. It would have been great to have raced them for 100 miles, something to ponder next year perhaps. Big thanks to <strong>Alan</strong> for somehow squeezing past vans coming the other way on lanes one-and-a-half vans w<strong>Dave</strong> for sterling work on the timing and navigating. <br />Lance Bellers, B Team Captain</p>\r\n<p>For a great perspective on the event, see Jon Pike's excellent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeand/the-running-blog/2013/jul/10/running-winning-losing\">Guardian blog</a><br /></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

          "content": "<p><strong>A late review of the Senior Men&rsquo;s Sussex Road Relays and a look back over the past years results</strong></p>\r\n<p>If anyone thought that the senior men&rsquo;s team would become complacent after decimating the Sussex Road relays 16 year old record last year they were in for a shock even without Senior Honey Badger and indiv. <br />The great thing about the Sussex Road Relays is it brings together all Team Phoenix&rsquo;s athletes whether you&rsquo;re an track star, marathon man or gearing up for the tri season, you are treated to just over 2 miles of speed induced pain fortunately the only real pain going to be experienced was by anyone wanting to take the title away.</p>\r\n<p>You may have missed the significances of how good a result this was if you had read the Sussex Athletics report so hear is the blow by blow account. <br />Leading into this race it was obvious that the main threat was going to come from the talented Hastings team and that we would be in for a good race, but with several withdraws of their key members it became clear that it was going to be Phoenix vs Brighton show down for the gold.</p>\r\n<p>With the rumour that Hastings big gun Adam Clark would be on first leg Phoenix chose to blood there latest super talented U17 Robbie Fitzgibbon who has been a revelation over the last year. After not looking too happy at having to run C team last year Robbie jumped up about 10 levels in performance and produced what must be an U17 record of 9.52 chancing down the inform Sam Bennett of Lewes AC with Brighton&rsquo;s Ian Crowe-Wright coming in a strong third. Darryl Hards who just missed out on a spot in the A team after having a fantastic first proper winter back running since his junior days. Darryl suffered a little in the first mile not being used to the speed of a fast start just coming off cross country training but still came home in 10.13 for 5th place. With Jon Tindell (C Team) having his first taste of a Sussex relays championship off the back of a very heavy training session running 12.19</p>\r\n<p>Dan Stepney after being given the nod for the final spot in the A team showed he was going to give it everything and by far had the best run of any race outs. Dan went off in hunt of the Lewes athlete Josh Burgess and it was not long before he was out in front and pushing hard, by the end of his leg he looked white as a sheet, although this had far more to do with his willingness to push himself to the max than the light snow showers we were experiencing.</p>\r\n<p>At this point Sam Kitchen (U17) was making good progress for the B team and was secretly locked in a battle with club mentor Joel K.49, a good run for Sam. Joel&rsquo;s course PB of 9.44 will however be safe for a couple more years.</p>\r\n<p>Will Durkin took over the running on leg 3 and it was much the same, pedal to the metal and with no one but himself to beat it was battle the elements and put some more time into the chasing teams, he finished in 10.00 flat a very good run!</p>\r\n<p>Jon Pepper has tasted nothing but Gold in Sussex competitions was eager to keep his 100% winning record in all team events over the last couple of years and this also served to test his speed ahead of the season&rsquo;s main target the Brighton Marathon going off hard it was clear Jon was in very good shape finishing in a fresh 9.41 and still with a 14mile marathon effort to do! Second fastest time of the day.</p>\r\n<p>Josh Guilmant took over for the penultimate leg and although not in the form of last year still brought a 9.58 out of his locker, a run of 9 years unbroken in this event. Although with the improvement of the team a time that would rank as one of the fastest overall legs in years gone by is now only an entry requirement to the Phoenix A team.</p>\r\n<p>The B Team were chopping and changing in position still trying to hang on to the bronze they won last year Finn McNally put in an impressive 10.16 off limited training with Triathlete Wes Mechen having his first taste of the relays and probably the shortest race he has ever run is a sol.49 off a long bike r. Max Pickard and Sean Scott rounded off the B team with strong performance and a credible 6th place against a much improved opposition from the other competing county teams.</p>\r\n<p>Last up for the A Team was track star Charlie Grice who has been pilling in the training in the lead up to an important track season where he intends to establish himself in the senior ranks, and he took off with just that fiery intent, like a hamster denied his wheel for a week he put in the fastest time of the day 9.37 Boom! This gave the team a final clocking of 59.08 and a massive 4m.02s win over Brighton with Lewes coming in for a well deserved Bronze.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Christ Hospital Relays &ndash; Sussex Champs results from 2005 onwards </strong></p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>2005 </strong><br /><strong>5th PHOENIX &lsquo;A&rsquo;</strong> 65:46<br />Dave Carter  10:41<br />Chris Edwards 11:29<br />Josh Guilmant 10:44<br />Joe Isherwood 10:39<br />Marcus Mickelthwaite 11:21<br />Dan Stepney  10:52 <br /><br /><strong>2006</strong><br /><strong>3rd PHOENIX &lsquo;A&rsquo;</strong>  65:42<br />Rob O&rsquo;Neal  11:28<br />Matt Barrie (U17) 10:42<br />James Miles  11:24<br />Josh Guilmant 10:20<br />Sam Rigby (U17)  11:23<br />Dan Stepney  10:25<br /><br />N/S <strong>PHOENIX &lsquo;B&rsquo;</strong> <br />Russell Pitman 11:17<br />James Miles 12:25<br />Carl Svoboda 12:49<br />Chris Webb  12:45<br />Steve Wainright 12:23<br /><br /><strong>2007 </strong><br /><strong>3rd PHOENIX &lsquo;A&rsquo;</strong> 63:52<br />Rob O&rsquo;Neill  11:57<br />Dan Stepney  10:15<br />Dave Carter  10:23<br />Lewis Hards (U17) 10:57<br />Josh Guilmant  10:01<br />Matt Barrie (U17) 10:19<br /><br />N/S <strong>PHOENIX &lsquo;B&rsquo;</strong> 79:06 <br />Finn McNally 11:45<br />Andrew Seivewright 13:38<br />Barnaby Savage 12:21<br />Terry Avey  13:53<br />Peter Hards  13:59<br />Andrew Haig  13:30<br /><br />Fastest Laps <br />Senior<br />2nd Josh Guilmant 10:01<br />Under 17<br />1st Matt Barrie 10:19<br /> <br /><strong>2008</strong><br />1st <strong>PHOENIX &lsquo;A&rsquo;</strong> 63.34 <br />James Miles  10:59<br />Matt Barrie  10:12<br />Dave Carter 10:31<br />Finn McNally  11:16<br />Josh Guilmant 10:12<br />Dan Stepney  10:24<br /><br />N/S <strong>PHOENIX &lsquo;B&rsquo; </strong>75:25<br />Miles Dav 12:19<br />Gus Kennedy  12:52<br />Calico Wells-Burton 12:27<br />Michael Murphy 12:34<br />Gary Judd  11:33<br />Andrew Haig  13:40<br /><br /><strong>2009</strong><br />3rd <strong>PHOENIX 'A'</strong> 63.23<br />Gus Kennedy 11.23<br />Matt Barrie  10.05<br />James Miles  10.45<br />Finn McNally  10.46<br />Dave Carter  10.29<br />Josh Guilmant  9.55<br /><br />Fastest Laps   <br />Senior   <br />2nd Josh Guilmant 9.55<br />    <br /><strong>2010</strong><br />2nd  <strong>PHOENIX 'A'</strong> 61.36<br />Sam Wade  10.31<br />Max Pickard U17 10.33<br />Finn McNally   10.20<br />Dan Stepney  10.15<br />Charlie Grice U17 9.54<br />Josh Guilmant 10.03<br /><br /><strong>PHOENIX 'B'</strong> <br />Jonas Wienecke 11.12<br />Miles Dav 11.47<br /><br />Fastest Laps <br />Under 17s<br />1st Charlie Grice 9.54<br />3rd Max Pickard 10.33<br /><br /><strong>2011</strong><br />1st <strong>Phoenix 'A'</strong> 61.08<br />Will Durkin (U17) 10.14<br />Max Pickard  10.53<br />Finn McNally  10.09<br />Josh Guilmant 9.55<br />Tom Hopkins  10.01<br />Charlie Grice (U17)  9.56<br /><br /><strong>Phoenix 'B'</strong>   70.12<br />James Miles  11.04<br />Ben Warren (N/S) 10.00<br />Sam Wade  10.30<br />Jake Elliott (U17) 10.36<br />Gary Thayre  12.46<br />Gary Durman 15.16<br /><br />Fastest Laps<br />Senior Men <br />1st Josh Guilmant 9.55<br />3rd Tom Hopkins 10.01<br />Fastest Laps <br />Under 17 Men <br />1st Charlie Grice 9.56<br />2nd Will Durkin 10.14<br />3rd Jake Elliott 10.36<br /><br /><strong>2012</strong><br />1st <strong>Phoenix 'A'</strong><strong> 58.27</strong> <strong>Record</strong><br />Will Durkin (U17) 9.57 <br />Ben Tickner  9.19 <br />Max Pickard  10.06 <br />Charlie Grice  9.41 <br />Josh Guilmant 9.49 <br />Jon Pepper  9.35 <br /><br />3rd <strong>Phoenix 'B'</strong> 63.06<br />Sam Wade  10.02<br />Jose Luceron 10.36<br />Jake Elliott (U17) 10.29<br />James Miles  11.12<br />Darryl Hards  10.20<br />Dan Stepney  10.27<br /><br /><strong>Phoenix 'C'</strong> <br />Robbie Fitzgibbon U17 11.04<br />Tobbias Bremer 11.11<br />Will Thompson U17 10.49<br />Robin Fitzgibbon 11.22<br /><br />Fastest Laps <br />Senior Men  <br />1st BenTickner<strong> 9.19 Record</strong><br />2nd Jon Pepper 9.35  <br />Under 17 Men <br />1st Will Durkin 9.57<br />2nd Jake Elliott 10.29<br />3rd Will Thompson 10.49<br /><br /><strong>2013</strong><br />1st <strong>Phoenix 'A'</strong> 59.08<br />Robbie Fitzgibbon U17 9.53<br />Dan Stepney  9.59<br />Will Durkin  10.00<br />Jon Pepper  9.41<br />Josh Guilmant 9.58<br />Charlie Grice  9.37<br /><br /><strong>Phoenix 'B' </strong> 65.48<br />Darryl Hards  10.13<br />Sam Kitchen U17 10.49<br />Finn McNally  10.16<br />Wes Mechen  11.49<br />Max Pickard  9.47*<br />Sean Scott  12.54*<br /><br /><strong>Phoenix 'C'</strong> <br />John Tindell  12.19<br /><br />Fastest Laps <br />Senior Men <br />1st Charlie Grice 9.37<br />2nd Jon Pepper 9.41<br />Under 17 Men <br />1st Robbie Fitzgibbon 9.53<br />2nd Sam Kitchen 10.49</p>\r\n<p></p>",

The youngest in the field, he showed great maturity, intelligence and courage.<br /><br />Earlier in the week <strong>Almi Nerurkar</strong> ran 4:51 for 1500m in an English Schools Cup Match in Croydon. This time places her on top of the UK under 13 rankings so far this year. <br /><br />In Eltham, <strong>Archie Davis</strong> broke 2mins for 800m and the Sussex County Under 15 record....so faster than Grice and faster than Ovett at that age...not bad Mr.Davies! <br /><br />Also at Eltham, <strong>Robbie Fitzgibbon</strong> ran a brave 1500m race to set a new PB of 3:52 and just oh so narrowly missed out on a World Youth Games qualifying time. At the weekend he bounced back with a bronze in the 1500m at the Southern U20 Champs in Watford, in his first year in this age group. <br /><br />At these same champs, in the seniors, <strong>Dan Stepney</strong> won a silver in the 800m and Team Captain <strong>Josh Guilmant</strong> ( The Mighty Gu! ) outsprinted the opposition to take the Southern 5kms Championship to add to his Sussex Title.<br /><br />The Phoenix is on fire and we've only just started this season so buckle up and be prepared for more great results this year!</p>",

We had to cycle the triathlon loop four<br />times instead of two - it nearly killed me in the triathlon so I was<br />worried about cycling up that massive hill four times.</p>\r\n<p>As I was not aware that it was also the national duathlon championships I<br />quickly had to find a trilux trisuit so had to drive around<br />Luxembourg for an hour before the race to pick one up or I would have<br />been disqualified. I was told before the race that I was only allowed to draft the women and Paulo pointed the women out to me I was supposed to run with. One of them<br />was the clear favourite - I know her as she is usually the only woman<br />to cycle the tour de Luxembourg (with the men!!). I was able to run with<br />them and even come second on the first 6 k run. I tried to catch the<br />first woman on the bike to work together and draft her but I could not<br />close the gap. Then Sandra (the favourite) joined me after half a lap on the<br />bike and told me to stay at her wheel. I hung on for dear life until we<br />caught the first woman and we cycled in a group for a while, taking turns<br />drafting off each other but I quickly realized that both women were way out<br />of my league so I had to let them go. Sandra cycled off like a maniac and<br />disappeared and I was able to sight the second woman for a while finishing<br />only 20 seconds behind her on the bike.</p>\r\n<p>Now, the best news was that I had a really good last run and I can now<br />call myself national vice champion in the elite (senior) category as the<br />second woman is a master (vet here). Who would have thought that I would<br />ever get a title when cycling is involved?! I got a fancy medal and they<br />played the national anthem. Thought it was quite funny as I thought I would<br />not even reach the third day of the challenge! On top of that, I also won the whole challenge in the elite category!<br />Walking anywhere is impossible at the moment so I am just sitting in a<br />chair with my medal around my neck.<br />I also got a mention and a picture in the national newspaper, I really<br />like the picture as it shows the final position between the three of us<br />(this one was taken on the first lap of the run - featured)</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tageblatt.lu/sport/story/Lieners-und-Huberty-holen-Titel-26752584\">http://www.tageblatt.lu/sport/story/Lieners-und-Huberty-holen-Titel-26752584</a></p>\r\n<p>I will definitely do this one next year again! I now have a reputation for<br />being the girl with a beer in her hand as soon as each of the races was<br />finished but I attribute that to my quick recovery!</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"../../../results\">http://www.brightonphoenix.org.uk/results</a></p>\r\n<p></p>",

The sea was pretty flat so sighting was not difficult and I was in a group of 7 or 8 a bit back from the leaders. 6th on the swim, but the group was pretty much together. <br />T1 was easy. No wetsuit, no number belt, just helmet on and grab the bike. <br />I came out on to the bike with a Swiss who quickly found a younger GB wheel to hang on to and he disappeared up the road. I got into a steady rhythm and the flat course and light wind helped but the road surface was not great, about half block paving and the rest patchy tarmac for four laps. After the last turn I spotted the Swiss up ahead and I was catching him, that wheel he was on earlier must have already finished.  I was 6th on the bike. <br />Started the run with the Swiss and we were together for 3 of the 4 laps. On each lap there was a short but quite steep climb otherwise it was fairly flat route through the bazaar. There were also 2 water stations on the lap and I poured most of the water I picked up over my head in an effort to keep cool. My running shoes were cleaner at the end of the race than at the start, and wetter. A quick glance at my watch showed 31 minutes for the first 3 laps of the run, at the start of the 4th lap the Swiss kicked and I had no response. I also got passed by another Brit in the last km. I slowed by about a minute on that final lap. <br />Overall I was pleased with the time and I enjoyed the race. Looking back I wonder if I pushed the bike a bit too hard and so losing a bit on the run, but at the time it felt right. In any case I was never going to get close to a medal as they were all 2:01's</p>\r\n<p>My splits are below <br />8 1315 Malcolm Hughes GBR 0:26:02( 6) 0:00:42 1:00:41( 6) 0:00:39 0:42:59( 12) 2:10:22</p>\r\n<p>Full results <br />http://www.alanyatriathlon2013.com/results.html</p>\r\n<p></p>",

August 4th saw Phoenix athletes doing just that at the Wealdon Manic Triathlon.</strong></p>\r\n<p><br /><em>Thank you to Colin Simpson for his report;</em></p>\r\n<p><br />A few of us dec. The event is a double triathlon; 300m swim, 11K bike, 3K run....then do it all again... (could also be done as a relay)<br />The venue is a private house with a small lake and whilst numbers were limited there are always a few fast guys and girls.</p>\r\n<p>The swim was done in small waves of 10-15 in a warmish lake. Wetsuits were optional and most went for the &lsquo;naked' option mainly because for the second swim you would probably have to go without a wetsuit (although apparently a couple of people d...mmm difficult). I dec't...much to his disappointment..... as I came out ahead of him!! Unfortunately he passed me up the 200m hill run to transition as I stopped to whip the wetsuit off. Bob was long gone...</p>\r\n<p>The bike was an undulating 10.5K. It was a pretty fast course despite some poor road surfaces. Both Bob and Ro had similar splits (2nd and 4th best) with me a couple of minutes down.</p>\r\n<p>The run was also undulating around the grounds. 2x1.5K, off road and rutted which proved awkward in places. I dec...too busy thinking about that second swim without a wetsuit...but luckily was called back without losing too much time. Bob seemed to have a storming run (3rd fastest I believe) and Ro also ran well as we all completed our first triathlon.</p>\r\n<p>Now the fun started.... another swim...shall I keep my trainers on for the 200m run down to the lake? No, better not, I will forget them...so I go barefoot and just grab hat and goggles and go for it. As I exit transition the marshal and I simultaneously notice that I still have my shades on - not great for swimming so back I go and take the opportunity to t/run later. Note I wasn't the only one to have problems of this type!!</p>\r\n<p>The swim for me was much slower without a wetsuit and still in oxygen debt but Ro and Bob seemed to cope much better.</p>\r\n<p>Onto the bike and I actually felt quite good and seemed to be going faster on the descent into Framfield but on the small climb to the village I got slower and that fateful bump bump happened as my rear tyre deflated... end of race for me so I walked back but dec!!<br />Both Bob and Ro almost matched their earlier results on Bike and Run to secure 2nd and 10th places overall.....not bad for a couple of old vets.</p>\r\n<p>This was a good fun race which, with a few tweaks, would be worth doing next year.</p>\r\n<p>Full Results here (Swim includes run to transition, Bike includes both other transitions)</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hedgehogtri.co.uk/web/hedgehogtri/results/2013/Manic/NewplacePark_manicTris_20130804_v0.pdf\">http://www.hedgehogtri.co.uk/web/hedgehogtri/results/2013/Manic/NewplacePark_manicTris_20130804_v0.pdf</a></p>",

It is pretty much flat, and has good PB potential.There is plenty of free parking right by the start and it took me about 75 mins to drive there from Brighton. The first mile, through the town centre, is a bit twisty and at one point near the start everyone has to go under a pedestrian underpass, so make sure you're near the front at that point. The route is then two laps along the river/through countrys've time to notice. The race seemed to attract a lot of good London-based runners, especially in the V40 category, so there were always people to run against. Overall, a good alternative half to Barns Green or Chichester for those looking to race one in late summer/early autumn.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ma.co.uk/News/Areas/Ma/UPDATE-Chip-times-and-childrens-Ma.htm\">Full Results Here</a></p>",

Just staying vertical and finishing with both shoes was an achievement!</p>\r\n<p><br />Being the last race of the season, both indiv<strong>U13 girls </strong>who started the day winning both indiv. On the day the race winner was <strong>Almi Nerurkar </strong>followed by <strong>Naomi Fonteyn</strong> in 2nd, <strong>Holly Luscombe</strong> 7th, <strong>Saoirse McGuinness</strong> 16th, <strong>Francesca White</strong> 23rd <strong>Connie Jankowski </strong>24th and <strong>Leanne Battmann</strong> 25th. Almi won the indiv, Naomi and Holly. It must, however, be noted that although only three runners score in the team all runners contribute towards the team success as every Phoenix runner that finishes ahead of a competitor can assist with the team score. The girls have managed to field several runners in each race and all should be congratulated.</p>\r\n<p><br />Unfortunately attendance hasn't been so good in all races in other categories. In the <strong>U13 boys</strong> there were only two Phoenix runners, where the ever present <strong>Joel Luscombe</strong> and <strong>Zac Elbourne</strong> finished 17th and 22nd, with the boy's team finishing 9th place in the league.</p>\r\n<p><br />In the <strong>U15 girls</strong> race again there were only two finishers. <strong>Charlotte Matthews</strong> had a fine run to finish 2nd and the ever present <strong>Anna Berry</strong> d. Although only in the first year of this age group, Charlotte's run helped her to secure indiv, with the team finishing in 5th place.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Oliver Johnson</strong> was the only Phoenix runner in the <strong>U15 boys</strong> race and had an excellent run to finish 2nd. This helped the team secure league silver medals. Although not running, as the indiv, <strong>Reuben Hoyte</strong> won the indiv.</p>\r\n<p><br />Another fine 2nd place on the day went to <strong>Jake Alger </strong>in the <strong>u17 Men</strong>, narrowly losing out to the indiv. The team finished 5th overall.</p>\r\n<p><br />The ladies were led home by <strong>Erica Martin</strong> in 18th placing her silver in the indiv's medals. Despite the also valiant efforts of <strong>Anita Jones</strong> 46th, <strong>Hildi Mitchell</strong> 62nd and <strong>Amanda Mello-Costa</strong> 76th the ladies finished 8th, which will probably result in a division 2 place next year. The veteran ladies team finished 11th.</p>\r\n<p><br />The senior's men team started the day only a few points away from silver medal position and well clear from the 4th place team, so at least a bronze medal looked guaranteed. However with no senior runners in attendance it was left to the veteran runners, not for the first time, to try and secure a senior team medal position. Unfortunately despite their efforts, with Haywards Heath fielding a strong team they just missed out on bronze by 10 points, finishing with 884 to the Haywards Heath 3rd place 874. The team were led home by <strong>Bruce Warren</strong> (V50) in 18th followed by <strong>Donald Maclellan</strong> (v40) in 34th, <strong>Nigel Herron </strong>(v40) 52nd, <strong>Jon Wright</strong> (v50) 68th, <strong>Jim Whitelehgg</strong> (v40) 70th, <strong>Andrew Neighbour</strong> (v40) 97th. The veteran's team d's league and Bruce Warren won indiv.</p>\r\n<p><br />There were also several Phoenix runners representing Brighton District in an inter area race at the start of the day. Results have not been published yet but well done to all those Phoenix runners that took part.</p>\r\n<p><br />For full results <a href=\"http://www.sussexathletics.org.uk/results.php#407\">http://www.sussexathletics.org.uk/results.php#407</a></p>\r\n<p><br />A massive thank you to Bruce Warren for this report.</p>",

The event was the first in the <strong>South East England triathlon Series</strong>. Charlotte stayed true to form finishing 3rd overall in a time of 31:27. She will be hoping to at least maintain her position on the leader board as the series progresses. Next race for her in this series will be the Br.</p>\r\n<p><br />On Saturday 31st May <strong>Charlotte</strong> competed in the <strong>Youth Aquathlon</strong> in Hyde Park London. She had a lot to do after a tough swim when she left the Serpentine in last (28th) place. A speedy transition gained her 2 places and out on the run she overtook 3 more competitors to cross the finish line in 23rd. The highlights for Charlotte were possibly diving into the Serpentine from about the same spot on the pontoon that Alistair Brownlee stood on a few hours later, and that final finish stretch on the blue carpet where she got her medal!</p>\r\n<p>Photos are from the London Aquathon.</p>",

Traversing the 100 miles South Downs Way, the race consists of 6 runners running 3 legs each and a harried driver in charge of transporting the runners to each handover point &amp; keeping a record of handover times.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>This year competition was fierce with a record number of teams entering.<br />Runners started in waves from 6am to 9am at Beachy Head near Eastbourne with handover points at 18 locations across the South Downs Way finishing at Chilcomb Sports Ground, near Winchester.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lizzy Miles</strong> started the only <strong>Phoenix Ladies</strong> team off at 6.30 in glorious sunshine. She handed to <strong>Liz Hall</strong> then <strong>Kathryn Harnett</strong>. A torrential down pour in leg 4 meant <strong>Caz Garrett</strong> came in soaked &amp; handed to <strong>Erica Martin</strong> then <strong>Hildi Mitchell</strong> who again saw the sun. The Ladies worked to keep the pace up but some of us (!) who had never done this kind of endurance race before d! As the day progressed the aim was to not be passed by the any of the Phoenix men's teams who had later starts. Crossing the finish line just after 8pm Liz Hall's teams finishing just in front &amp; behind her.  Total time; 13:32:53.</p>\r\n<p>Prizes are given for 1st &amp; 2nd places however the Phoenix Ladies got a special mention as they were just under a minute behind second place (52 seconds in fact). So close yet so far - training for next year has already started!!</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Phoenix Men's B team</strong> showed the ladies how it's done finishing 2nd in their category and receiving one of the coveted medals. It was <strong>Malcolm Kemp</strong>'s 17th consecutive relay and he was joined by <strong>Matt Greenall, Jon Wright, Lance Bellers, Phil Hampshire </strong>&amp;<strong> Phil Grabsky</strong> . Starting at 8am they stormed across the line just after 8.30pm, completing the race in 12:34:18.</p>\r\n<p>Finishing 4th in their category, the <strong>Phoenix Vets team</strong> of <strong>Nigel Herron, Donald Maclellan, Jim Whitelegg, Jon Pike Tom Fars</strong>&amp;<strong> Dave Powell </strong>completed in 11:32:45. Dave Powell took 2 Phoenix records on his legs &amp; it is understood Nigel &amp; Tom were very late stand ins.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Phoenix Men's A Team</strong>, who started at 9am, crossed the finish in 11:02:51, 4th overall. The team consisted of <strong>Jose Luceron, Dave Carter, James Bullen, Tobias Bremer, Tom Sanderson </strong>&amp;<strong> Andy Bone</strong>, who only stood in on Thursday when James Miles was taken ill.</p>\r\n<p>A special mention needs to be made to the drivers of the teams, without whom it would not be possible. Not only do they ensure the teams reach each handover point in time they keep record of times &amp; in the case of Ro have to listen to an awful lot of chat!<br />Phoenix Ladies' Patient Driver: <strong>Ro Harrington</strong><br />Phoenix Men's B Team Driver: <strong>Petra Kopp</strong><br />A Team Driver - <strong>James Miles</strong><br />Vets Driver - <strong>John Marinko<br /></strong></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

          "content": "<p>Congratulations to Simon Taylor who, just a year after his first ever  triathlon, represented GB in the M50-54 category and came an excellent  6th. Cross Triathlon is the equivalent of cross-country and mountain  bikes are used. The swim was 1.5K, the bike r. Simon was sixth in the M50-54 category. Here is his account of the race:</p>\r\n<p><em><br />One of my priorities was to keep relaxed whist also maintaining a decent pace in the 1.5km swim. The first lap went smoothly without too much grappling going on. The Sea temp was 18.5', beautiful crystal clear water, I could see the scuba diver v. I exited the water after the first 750m lap and d, the field was spread out by now. After the run it took a while to get a decent swim pace going again.<br /><br />Transition 1 went ok and I soon passed a few people on the bike, before starting the first long ascent of the initial 15km bike lap. The first descent was fairly steep with gullies and various sizes of rocks to look out for. The bike section had single track, double track, steep ups/downs, trees, brambles, sand gravel, fast runs and slower technical areas, a mix of all you could expect on a good mtb course. The mtb course has two sections where you carry your bike up, one is called the 'crying wall' if it was much steeper you'd need a rope. On the second lap I was literally pouring with sweat climbing up this beast. As to be expected the second bike lap felt tougher than the first, I passed a few people and a few people passed me. I d't come a cropper and get injured on mtb course which was another priority. A few r.<br /><br />No problems in T2 and off on the 10km run. About 4km of the run was on sandy beaches which was tough going for tired legs. Running over the wobbly rope br(four times) was also tricky on the legs. I passed a few people including one of the Elites who was not having a good day and looked like he may have crashed on the bike. Second lap and time to mentally dig in. My trainers were soaked with sea water and feeling heavy. I passed a few people and was passed by more people a mix of those on their first lap or faster people on the second lap.<br /><br />Although I was the least experienced and one of the oldest in the team I was the second out of the 14 members of the Great Britain age group team to finish the race.<br />I came 6th in my category. I am fairly pleased with this.<br /><br />One rule of these event that stood out - drafting is allowed on the bike but not between men and women!<br /></em></p>\r\n<p><em>My tip for anyone who hasn't done a triathlon with a 1500m swim in two laps where you exit the water and run about 150m on soft sand before re-entering the water. Don't think that will give you a breather for the second 750m swim, it can mess with your swim pace.<br /><br />Great event, very well organised and an unforgettable experience.<br /></em><br />Simon</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2014_sardinia_etu_tnatura_cross_triathlon_european_championships/268339\">Full results </a></p>",

It's an open water swim followed by a mixed terrain cycle (all off road) and a beautiful run by the lake. A lovely evening. Transitions all working well.</p>\r\n<p>Swim (300m) 06:19 T1 00:59 Cycle (4km) 14:21 T2 00:21 Run (4km) 24:51</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stuweb.co.uk/race/Jt/\">http://www.stuweb.co.uk/race/Jt/</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>Br, at Dartford, Kent </strong></p>\r\n<p>Charlotte was really looking forward to the event, the second in the South-East regional series.<br />Things began with a 400m open water swim in a relatively clean lake. With the boys and girls competing at the same time, as is usual, there was some &lsquo;firm' positioning by some of the competitors. <br />Wetsuit slipped off well giving a speedy transition followed by a lightening moving jump on the bike. The bike course was on one s. Charlotte's cycling really showing some improvement both in speed and bike handling.<br />Another speedy transition and Charlotte was in first female place. Out on the run Charlotte made an early turn failing to complete the full run circuit and had to notify the organisers that she should be disqualified. She lost a valuable score for the regional series.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.br.co.uk/race-calendar/br/\">http://www.br.co.uk/race-calendar/br/</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>Wednesday 2nd July Hever Castle (2nd) evening Triathlon </strong></p>\r\n<p>1st girl (2nd overall) 13-15 year age group. Same route as the first event a month earlier. Another beautiful evening with the added excitement (or embarrassment) of Charlotte's mum Judith having a go at her first open water Tri!</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stuweb.co.uk/race/LD/\">http://www.stuweb.co.uk/race/LD/</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sunday 6th July Human Race SuperTri at Eton Dorney 15-16 (Youth) High Performance event</strong></p>\r\n<p>This was the 4th race in the SE regional series. With Charlotte having been disqualified from the 2nd event and missed the third it was crucial for her to complete this event and perform well if she was to regain some lost ground on the regional table. Weather conditions were pretty . <br />Charlotte had a reasonable swim leaving the lake in 8th place, just in the first half of the field. Transition went well and with 3 girls ahead Charlotte got herself into a small pack of girls hoping to work together to pull in the leaders. This wasn't to be but with another fine transition in T2 Charlotte set out on the run in 5th place. The run is Charlotte's strongest discipline but she just couldn't catch the girl ahead. Charlotte held onto her 5th place overall, really pleased with her result.</p>\r\n<p>Charlotte is getting to meet some familiar and friendly faces at these events with the series in the SE region prov. With the 4 leading girls in this event Charlotte was really pleased to have <em>secured a first place in the SE series.</em></p>\r\n<p>Swim(400m) 06:49 T1 58.0 Cycle (10.6km) 20:23 T2 41.0 Run (2.5km) 09:46</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://humanrace.co.uk/results-archive/2014/supertri/all-results\">http://humanrace.co.uk/results-archive/2014/supertri/all-results</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>A huge effort - the Girl's on fire!</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Surprisingly he is the first Phoenix runner to run the 1500m in the Commonwealth Games.His heat is today Fr.</p>\r\n<p>The Commonwealths have been quite a good championships for our club. Back in 1986 Steve Ovett won the 5000m, not bad for an Olympic 800m Champion! In 1990 Mark Rowland came 7th in the 5000m. In 2002 Pat Davoren came 9th in the 3000m Steeplechase. But our most successful athlete was a Phoenix second claim member. Sally Gunnell won gold and silver over the 100m hurdles in 1986 and 1990, she also won gold over 400m hurdles in 1990 and 1994 as well as two 4 x 400m relay golds in 1990 and 1994.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most significant Phoenix performances at the Commonwealths came back in 2002 from Honorary Phoenix Member Joel K. Competing for England Joel made the semi finals of the 800m. It is no exaggeration to say that the experiences Joel picked up in his International career have boosted the performances of our Phoenix M. One of the people who has really benefitted from Joel's help and input is none other than Charlie Grice.</p>\r\n<p><br />Now back to training for the rest of you so that I may write your names up as well!</p>\r\n<p>Cheers</p>\r\n<p>Paul</p>\r\n<p>(Chairman of Phoenix)</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Inevitably the m&ndash; but not much, we were never out of the top ten. Robbie Fitzgibbon ran 19:38 for 9th place, Jake Alger ran 19:31 to maintain the position, Sam Wade ran 19:01 for eighth and finally Jon Pepper let fly with 18:37 and 7th place. Great race, great tactics.<br /><br />Meanwhile we fielded an incomplete B team which, had it been complete would surely have kept them well in the mix.

The course at Lancing was sopping wet and positively lethal on the steeper descents.</p>\r\n<p>O60 men came a close third (bronze) in an amazingly competitive race. Special mention should be made of <strong>Paul Whelpton</strong> who ran a blinder taking indiv. <strong>Colin Simpson</strong> (running an astonishing four minutes plus faster than last year!) and <strong>Andrew Haig</strong> were the other scorers with <strong>Malcolm Kemp</strong> in sturdy support.</p>\r\n<p>The O50 men's race proved to be a very tight one as well with just two points separating the top three team positions. <strong>Bruce Warren</strong> picked himself up after falling (twice) to lead the Phoenix team home in sixth with <strong>Nigel Herron</strong> close behind in eighth and the third scorer <strong>Lance Bellers</strong> in twelfth. We had to settle for bronze but an exciting race all the same. <strong>Phil Grabsky</strong>, <strong>Jon Wright</strong> and <strong>Malcolm Hughes</strong> ran well to complete our second scoring team.</p>\r\n<p>The O40 men went into this race looking to sneak a bronze medal given the known strengths of Brighton and Lewes in this age category. However some dogged performances on the day pushed us into silver medal position only 2 points behind the leading Brighton team and 5pts ahead of Lewes in 3rd. New vet <strong>Dave Carter</strong> led the team home in 4th place followed by <strong>Donald Maclellan</strong> in 5th who fought well to overhaul a Lewes runner on the final descent. <strong>Matt Greenall</strong> had an outstanding performance to finish in 10th and <strong>Austen Hunter</strong>, who only dec, was the 4th scorer in a very credible 17th. <strong>Tom Sanderson</strong>, <strong>Jim Whitelegg</strong>, <strong>Andrew Neighbour</strong> and <strong>Ro Harrington</strong> made up our second scoring quartet and finished 5th in the team standings. Well done all.</p>\r\n<p>There was a complete O35 women's team led out by a resergent <strong>Deb Friis</strong> finishing in 36th place with <strong>Kathryn Harnett</strong> not far behind. The team was completed by <strong>Natalie Davis</strong> who ran strongly in, as we understand it, her first ever cross-country race. The team was fourth of the four scoring teams but well in the mix.</p>\r\n<p >Check the details <a href=\"../../results\">here</a></p>\r\n<p></p>",

The tip of the day being &lsquo;pace yourself'!</p>\r\n<p>Well done to both our <strong>U13 Teams</strong> who, for many, ran in their biggest race to date both in status and number of competitors - a huge field of 227. The <strong>U13 girls </strong>team finished 29th and the <strong>Boys</strong> 10th out of 34 teams, and second only to Lewes out of the Sussex teams, finally beating our big rivals (and friends) Brighton and Hove. All the young athletes put in 100% effort &amp; all the Parents who came to support. It's worth noting how close the field was with the Phoenix boys finishing within a minute or 2 of the winner.</p>\r\n<p>Further congratulations goes to <strong>Almi Nerurkar</strong> for finishing a storming 6th in the <strong>U15 girls</strong>. A fantastic result in a competitive field, placing the U15 girls team 25th.</p>\r\n<p>Also running for Phoenix were <strong>U17 Girls</strong>, <strong>U20 Girls &amp; Boys</strong> &amp; the <strong>senior women's team </strong>(who finished 25th out of 51 teams).</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>senior men's</strong> race was always going to be a hotly contested race with Phoenix athletes <strong>Jon Pepper </strong>and <strong>Ben Tickner</strong> up against each other again. Jon Pepper led for most of the 15km race but it was Ben's sprint finish, and no doubt determination to not be pipped at the post again, that catapulted him over the line in first position with Jon finishing third. With only 4 seconds between winner and fourth place and Ugandan Olympian Paskar Owor also in the mix, the race was riveting stuff to watch unfold.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, a big THANK YOU to <strong>Bruce Warren</strong> and his team of <strong>Phoenix marshals </strong>who helped the race run smoothly &amp; safely. Bruce has been liaising with SEAA and was at Stanmer from 8.45 to 5pm - thank you!!</p>\r\n<p><em>Photographers: Lance Bellers, Stephen Hardman, Dav, Gareth Wellings</em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Almi has finished 1st in all 3 races giving her a gold medal in the overall league standing...she really couldn't have done more!</p>\r\n<p>Not to be outdone, <strong>Lucas Nerurkar</strong> finished first in the U11 boys race and the U13 boys took silver in the league.</p>\r\n<p>The women had another complete team running with <strong>Erica Martin</strong> finishing a respectable 9th. Good to see <strong>Lizzy Miles</strong> back and in very good form despite a few months off with an injury. Mixed results for the ladies in the league standing, owing to age groups being mixed to complete teams during the season but we're definitely top of division 2 for the Seniors!</p>\r\n<p>As for the Men's teams...... <strong>Paul Whelpton</strong> (V60) completed a hat trick finishing 1st in the all 3 races. The Vet Men's team finished 3rd in the overall standings, with the Senior A &amp; B Teams 4th in the first &amp; second divisions.</p>\r\n<p>It's also been brought to our attention that the <strong>Vet Men</strong> (v40, v50, v60 and overall O40) have medals in every county cross country event this season (relays, championships and league)....way to go guys!</p>\r\n<p>Results: <a href=\"http://www.sussexathletics.org.uk/results.php#455\">http://www.sussexathletics.org.uk/results.php#455</a></p>\r\n<p><em>Racing photos by Matt Greenall</em></p>",

Sadly this wasn't the case and it was raining heavily on the morning of the race. Luckily this stopped just as the race began.<br />The first 5km run was undulating but a good route and I felt strong. The bike route was also very undulating, with a lot of long, gradual climbs and fast descents. There were a lot of roundabouts which were slightly hairy at times due to the amount of water on the roads.<br />The final run took place on the same course as the first but was only one lap of 2.5km this time so was over with very quickly.</p>\r\n<p>I was very pleased with how the race went and although would have liked to have in a higher position overall I was 2nd from GB which should hopefully qualify me for next year's race.\"</p>\r\n<p>Erica is being modest...take a look at her times...!</p>\r\n<p>Time                           Run                          T1 Bike                        T2                         Run<br />01:10:05 00:18:14 00:01:42\t00:39:54\t00:01:42\t00:08:33</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2015_alcobendas_etu_sprint_and_standard_distance_duathlon_european_champion/271531\">http://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2015_alcobendas_etu_sprint_and_standard_distance_duathlon_european_champion/271531</a></p>\r\n<p ><strong><span ><br /></span></strong></p>",

Four teams, along with their drivers, flew the flag for Phoenix. A record number of 67 teams ran this year. With start times staggered depending on predicted times, results are split into different race categories.</p>\r\n<p><span ><strong>Vets report</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>The Vets were conf, and their predicted time would have had them win fairly comfortably in most of the last years. The main aim was to go and execute the plan.<br /><br />The strong team consisted of <strong>Donald Maclellan, Tom Sanderson, Jon Pike, Matt Greenall, Dave Carter </strong>&amp;<strong> Dave Powell</strong> . A huge thanks to <strong>John Marinko</strong> who drove.</p>\r\n<p>Donald Maclellan gave us an early lead on the difficult Seven Sisters Leg 1, and from then on Basingstoke, Lewes and Phoenix swopped around the top 3 places, with very strong runs on Leg 4 (Dave Powell), Leg 5 (Dave Carter) and Leg 7 (Donald again) putting us into second. However from this point on, Lewes and Basingstoke found an extra gear and had a very entertaining race which Lewes finally won clocking in the low 10:50s. Although we realised the medals were getting out of our reach, our team continued to run very well, finishing in 11:07 a ten minute club vets record over this longer version of the relay course, three minutes quicker than our most optimistic estimate for the day. We also broke 7 club leg records - three for Dave Powell and two each for Dave Carter and Matt Greenall. Dave Carter's 55:17 on Leg 17 took three minutes off the previous vets best and may stand for some time unless he has another go in 2016.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span >Women's  report</span></strong><br />Despite the very early set off (leaving Withdean at 4.45am) the sole Phoenix Women's team had a spritely start with <strong>Erica Martin</strong> taking second place in the first leg. Erica stayed true to form all day, completing the most miles for the team (19.4miles). <br /><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Lizzy Miles</strong> kept up the lead in leg 2 finishing some 4 minutes ahead of her predicted time. It is definitely worth mentioning Lizzy ran her final leg (leg 13) 6 minutes faster than predicted.</p>\r\n<p>In leg 3 <strong>Caz Garrat</strong>, in her second ever relay, stormed in first place. Caz beat her predicted times in her next 2 legs.</p>\r\n<p>We were over taken by 2 very quick men's teams in leg 4 but <strong>Deb Friis</strong> kept us first in the women's race. She kept up the pace in legs 10 &amp; 16. If memory serves me right, Debs ran her first relay 10years ago.</p>\r\n<p>In Leg 5, ran by <strong>Kathryn Harnett</strong>, we were over taken by the Arena 80 Women's team, despite Kathryn running 2:15 over her predicted time.</p>\r\n<p>We were still in the medals following leg 6 ran by <strong>Liz Hall</strong>, Team Captain extraordinaire, in 2 minutes over her predicted time. Unfortunately we were unable to hold onto this as the day progressed. Liz won the unofficial award for being closest to her predicted times over all the legs, so she does win the prize of being captain of the Women's team next year. Congratulations, Liz!</p>\r\n<p>The final team member was <strong>Hildi Mitchell</strong> who's navigational skills, time keeping &amp; expert driving need to go on her CV!</p>\r\n<p><strong><span >Senior Teams</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>A Team:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Driver: Ro Harrington</p>\r\n<p>Runners: James Miles; Tobias Bremer; Jose Luceron; Alex Bonzi; Paul Lawrence; Ray Matthews.</p>\r\n<p>The Senior As were lucky to field a team as a late injury led to a search for a last minute replacement; thanks to Ray for stepped up the evening before ensuring the team were able to run.</p>\r\n<p><strong>B Team:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Driver: Sue Hudson</p>\r\n<p>Runners: Malcolm Kemp; Jon Wright; Phil Grabsky; Andrew Neighbour; Colin Simpson; Paul Whelpton</p>\r\n<p>The Senior Bs were left with a desperate last minute search for an  experienced driver when their driver was rendered unable to drive. A  massive thank you to Sue Hudson for stepping in &amp; warm wishes to  their original driver.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"../../../results\">http://www.brightonphoenix.org.uk/results</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

          "content": "<p ><strong><span >2 Swim 4 Life</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Ok I d't manage 24 miles, but, hang on, I SWAM 15 MILES! The training had gone well, no injuries, and just a couple of weeks out with a bad cold early in the year. I really enjoyed finding my swimming mojo again, and plan to keep on focussing on improving my times over some shorter distances. I think coach Brian is pleased with the efforts I've been putting in in the pool, and there is plenty to build on.</p>\r\n<p>Me and official 'swim buddy', Pete, travelled up straight from school and put up our tent at Guildford l(rather later than ) with some other swimmers. A group of ladies (the marvellous merma), who were a team, let us join their table in a busy restaurant, but another soloist on our table managed to put the fear into me by announcing it made ironmans look easy (I'll now say that it depends on the ironman - I've done 6 and some were easier and some were not).  Anyway, I managed to only let that wake me up in the night twice with palpitations and woke before my alarm at 5 ready to go.</p>\r\n<p>We got to the l. Gradually others arrived and we went in to register. There was some milling about and my friend Clare arrived to support. I think supporting is at least a two person job, and Clare and Pete managed to establish a good early routine.</p>\r\n<p>The first mile felt horrible. I was worried about being the slowest in my lane (which I was) and I was unprepared for how much chop there was out in the m, 50m pool with a breeze and all the other swimmers around.  I was also dreadfully nervous and that impacted badly on my rhythm. The second mile felt much better. The routine was: get in at the top of the hour, swim 32 lengths, get out, wrap in 'dry robe', change into dry cossie, put on warm clothes, then sit down and rest before heading back to the pool to strip off the clothes, put the robe back on and wait for the top of the hour to start again.</p>\r\n<p><br />After 5 miles the swimming was going well and I was enjoying it. I was fairly consistent in my times and wasn't too cold. Then my family and Alison from work arrived and I felt very supported but at the same time very aware of a weight of expectation. Pete and Jon were worrying that I hadn't eaten enough and were trying to get me to eat more. However, eating was making me feel nauseous and dizzy which was then making me anxious. A couple of trips to the loo seemed to stabilise my stomach as I switched to carb drink, gels and shot blocks. My k. I swam thorough a mile where I felt dizzy and worried whether I was in fact getting too cold but things improved and when my coach Brian, and his wife Lesley and daughter Teresa came I had a good few miles with support at both ends of the pool, although in between I d't stray too far from the loos as my stomach was a bit upset still.</p>\r\n<p>I got to 11 miles and then apparently my lips started to look a bit blue, and I was getting a shakes a bit in between swims. We were told the water was 22.5, but another swimmer reckoned he measured it at 19. It was certainly warmer than when my club mates d't a walk in the park, weather wise. I opted to put on a wetsuit which was nice and warming but which d. The miles clocked up, the sun went down, the k, and then my friend Cat arrived, replacing Brian, Lesley and Teresa.</p>\r\n<p>There was something very nice about swimming in the dark. The atmosphere changed and the l. Although I d't make it back to our tent, we d! A few people had ordered pizza and it was quite tempting! I swam on through the rain. Jon went to get a few hours sleep in the tent and Cat and Pete stood in the rain counting lengths. Pete was trying to encourage me by telling me my times but I'm afra. (Which I told him - sorry Pete!)</p>\r\n<p>I got through half way which was a milestone especially cons'd felt at mile 6. In my head I wanted to get to 16. My shoulders were now telling me I probably wouldn't finish 24. The first few strokes of every mile were hard but I settled into it. The pain eased sometimes but was getting worse through each swim. I focussed just on the next mile.</p>\r\n<p>At some point in mile 15 it just became impossible to turn my left arm over. Each turn at the end of a length pushed pain through my shoulder and I could no longer turn my hand over to look at my watch. I tried breast stroke (almost impossible in a wetsuit!) with the most puny little arm strokes! I had another couple of goes at crawl. I tried swimming one armed. Each time I tried to move my left arm I winced in pain. Lisa from work had arrived and I was so pleased to see her but I knew I was doing my last mile. I kicked the last 400m to complete mile 15. I certainly wasn't going to leave a mile dangling!</p>\r\n<p>Pete and Cat tried to persuade me to carry on but when I got into the hot tub to see if warmth on my shoulder would release it, it was clear that I couldn't move enough. I toyed with the . I love kicking, but I would have had to do it with my arms by my s! There were some other swimmers, including some teams, in the hot tub and they supported my decision to stop. At that point there was no telling if I had done some serous damage.</p>\r\n<p>Cat took me back to the hotel and helped me change, and then took me home. Jon and Pete cleared up and packed the car. I hope they weren't too disappointed. I haven't asked because I don't want to think about it. There was absolute agony in my left shoulder the following day but the physio thinks I haven't torn anything and that I will make a full recovery. When he asked what I'd been up to and I told him, he sa, 'Fifteen miles! Yes that's a long way!' But he also sa... That's for later discussion!<br /> In the meantime there is the small matter of 9 'owed' miles. I plan to swim them (on the hour, every hour) at Club La Santa in August. Hopefully I can do a bit more awareness and fund raising for the charity place2be as well (https://www.justgiving.com/Hildi-Mitchell1/) as prov.  Although I wasn't able to complete my challenge, keeping that charitable work in my head while training really helped me get the miles in. 15 miles really is quite a long way to swim and I should be pleased with that.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>(<em>You certainly should, Hildi!)</em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Spencer Thomas just missed out on a place in the 800m final after winning his heat and coming 3rd in his semi final. In both his races he ran intelligently and courageously leading into the last 200m.</div>\r\n<div>Robbie Fitzgibbon had to run his second fastest ever 1500m to make the final as a fastest loser and then he decisively and with such courage took up the racing from a way out and nearly won the final. In the end he came 5th just a second off gold which is the best position ever in these championships by a Phoenix athlete. Steve Ovett won the 800m back when he was a member of Brighton and Hove but Robbie's placing was better than the current Uk Champion Charlie Grice ran and also better than World Junior silver medallist Johan Boakes and former UK champ and a world age group record breaker Br.....not bad Mr Fitzgibbon sir!</div>\r\n<div>Meanwhile across the world in Colombia Toby Harries made it through a heat and a semi at the World Youth Championships to carry the GB vest home in 6th place in the 200m final and to become the only Sussex athlete (at whatever age group) to run under 21 seconds for the distance......so club and county records for Toby from all age groups U17 to Seniors....despite what it may say on the Sussex website!</div>\r\n<div>And back in Europe Charlie Grice ran a new 1500m pb in Holland which was also a qualifying mark for this years World Championships and next years Olympic Games! No club record though Charlie!</div>\r\n<div><strong>So bearing in mind how young all these athletes are I'll just ask that question again...Was this last weekend one of the most important weekends ever in the history of our club?</strong></div>\r\n<div><strong><br /></strong></div>\r\n<div><strong>Answer....yes it was!......SO FAR</strong></div>\r\n<div><strong><br /></strong></div>\r\n<div>Hats off to the Fantastic Phoenix Five!</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>",

Charlie lined with the slowest PB of the 12 finalists but still managed to finish 9th. He was in contention with 200m left and it is surely just a matter of time before he closes down on the leaders.</p>\r\n<p><span>So lets look at some more stats... Charlie was just 2 seconds off winning the race, came ahead of the current Olympic silver medalist and was just one place behind the current World Championship silver medallist. Charlie was also not just the only Brit in the final but also the only European. His 9th place is the best by a British man in a 1500m Worlds final since 2007 when Andy Baddely also came 9th.</span><br /><br /><span>In the final there were 6 men with faster PBs than Seb Coe and another 2 more faster than Steve Ovett. Coe and Ovett were once the great gods of UK m. When Steve Cram was 19 he came 8th in the Olympic 1500m final. When Steve Ovett was 20 he came 5th in the Olympic 800m final but got knocked out in the semi finals of the 1500m. When Seb Coe was 21 he came 3rd in the European 800m championships.</span><br /><br /><span>Our Charlie is right where he needs to be right now...onwards and upwards!</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.athleticsweekly.com/featured/charlie-grice-takes-conf/\">Here's Athletic Weekly's take</a>.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"../../results\">Results here</a>.</p>",

After a week of training he ran in an open 12k race organised alongs(run over 34k and 60k!). The 12k <strong>Trails du Sancy</strong>was a mountain race with a straight ascent and descent, taking in 550 metres of climbing (and back down again), reaching an altitude of 1540 metres. The race set out from Le Mont Dor&eacute;, a popular ski resort in winter. Donald sat in around 12th place for most of the climb but if you've ever seen him running down hills you won't be surprised to know that on the steep technical descent, he clawed his way to 7th overall, missing out on an age category win by just 5 seconds. \"A thoroughly enjoyable race in fine weather\".</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://orga.xttr63.com/images/resultats/SANCYCDF12KM.pdf\">Full Results</a></p>",

I dec&lsquo;The Year of Going Big&rsquo;.<br /><br />Long story short, I signed up to do all four of Centurion Running&rsquo;s 100-mile races. Finishing each of them earns you a very stylish belt buckle which is emblazoned with &ldquo;Finisher&rdquo; if you complete within the 28-30 hour cut-off or &ldquo;One day&rdquo; if you dip under 24-hours. If you finish all four 100s within a calendar year, you get an enormous additional &ldquo;Grand Slam&rdquo; buckle that looks like it should be able to self-transform into a Tardis. <br /><br />The Centurion 100s are along the Thames Path in early April, the South Downs Way in m, the North Downs Way in early August, and a combination of the Thames Path and The R. The first three each earn you 4 UTMB points and are Western States Qualifiers. The final one bags you 3 UTMB points.<br /><br />Centurion Running (who also organise four 50 mile events) rely very heavily on an army of volunteers and there is a waiting list to join them. That&rsquo;s how good Centurion are. They care deeply about runners, staff, volunteers, supporters, the public, and the local environment - and it shows. Routes are wonderfully marked and markings are removed as soon as humanly possible after races. Amazingly stocked a&ndash; 11 mile intervals along every route. I have seen runners stop m&rsquo; litter. Everyone is treated with admiration and respect. Support is simply unstinting. Many people&rsquo;s stories are truly astonishing. A lot of emotion gets expressed. Needless to say, runners and volunteers come back year after year. <br /><br />If you can run a marathon (and nearly anyone can), then you could run a 100. <br />Running your first 100 is satisfying and brings obvious bragging rights. &ldquo;Have I run a marathon? Well, as it happens&hellip;&rdquo; Running four 100s in 7-months is a really interesting challenge, as much about coping between events as within them. And beyond stoking smugness, you get enough metal to start your own scrap yard.\"</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Tom ran 23:43:18 <a href=\"http://www.centurionrunning.com/live/2015-autumn-100-live/\">See full results</a></p>",

In fact they were an agonising six points away from first place &ndash; that went to Wadhurst Runners.<br /><br />That wasn't the end of it though &ndash; as you can see from the photographs, our table was groaning with awards (and empty glasses) by the end of proceedings. Paul Whelpton was first placed V5 male and Andrew Haig was first V6 male. Andrew has won his age group now for ten consecutive years. Nigel Herron it was, though, who carried off most gongs. Apart from the team medal he was also 12th in the overall men's placings and was third in the fiercely fought MV3 category. <br /><br />The winner of the junior male category was <strong>Will Russell</strong>. Those of you who know Will knowl how richly deserved this is. Will is one of the most committed and regular competitors in the club.<br /><br />Well done all!</p>\r\n<p><em>Pix by Lance</em><br /><br /><br /><strong></strong></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Sussex Grand Prix 2016</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The partial success this year has given us a taste for more &ndash; maybe we can even challenge for the top club award (something we achieved over several seasons a dozen or more years ago). To do this we need runners from each section of the club &ndash; juniors, seniors and vets both male and female to commit to running eight of seventeen races over the course of the year.</p>\r\n<h3><em>This is how it works:</em></h3>\r\n<p><em>You can find a list of this year's <a href=\"http://sussexgrandprix.co.uk/news/races-2016/\">races</a> together with results and rules at the SGP site <a href=\"http://www.sussexgrandprix.co.uk/\">http://www.sussexgrandprix.co.uk/</a> When entering, as a member of one of the twenty three competing clubs you will automatically entered for the competition. Remember to put in the correct club reference 'Brighton Phoenix' and your date of birth.<br /><br />The first male or female SGP runner to finish a race scores 500 points, the next 499 and so on. You can run as many of the seventeen races as you like but your best eight scores will be taken into cons. These must include two 10M+ races to optimise your score. If you can't manage eight then whatever score you have managed will figure in the results.<br /><br />Points are awarded for men overall, women overall, senior teams (10 to count), vet teams (5 to count) and then the overall club competition. There are also awards for best juniors (U20) and those who have run the most races.<br /><br />The whole thing can give a real focus to your running year especially since the SGP website features incremental results so that you can see exactly where you are placed in relation to the competition.<br /><br />Phoenix's SGP representative is <a href=\"mailto:lancebellers@btinternet.com\">Lance Bellers</a> and he is going to be making great efforts to boost our input into this amazing competition. Ideally we need more women, more seniors and indeed more vets. If Lance comes your way or you bump into any other of the SGP regulars, have a chat, find out what it's all about. It might give a real lift to your running year.<br /><br /></em></p>",

He was referring partly to our medal winners but also to the strength in depth of our team. Indeed they had won the team competition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Charlie Grice</strong> was defending the 1500M title he won last year and was the event favourite. He d't disappoint. Taking it out with two laps to go, he ran a perfectly judged race to win the final in (for him) the modest time of 3:46.50. It was great too to see <strong>Robbie Fitzgibbon</strong> make the final and achieve an excellent fourth spot (3:48.62). <strong>Archie Davis</strong> will be disappointed with his fifth place in the previous day's heats running almost eight seconds slower than his season's best and failing to meet the final.</p>\r\n<p>We had three athletes in the 800M all running in separate heats with the finalists selected on time. <strong>Finley Bigg</strong>ran first coming second in 1:53.82, Then <strong>Dan Stepney</strong>, third in 1:51.46 and finally <strong>Spencer Thomas</strong>, second in 1:51.34. Spencer it was who made the final, running 1:51.35 and making it into silver medal position.</p>\r\n<p>Then there was Toby. <strong>Toby Harries,</strong> just 17 years old and now British indoor 200M champion. He had won his heat in a 21:22 PB, the semi final in an improved 21:12 and then stormed around the difficult outer outer lane on the last bend to overhaul the pack in a thrilling finish. Time 21:13. Great stuff Toby.</p>\r\n<p>What have all these athletes got in common? They are part of Jon Bigg's coaching group. A proud day for them and a proud day for Jon as well &ndash; congratulations.</p>\r\n<p>You can find the results at</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.britishathletics.org.uk/results/20160227_sheffield/timetable/index/index.html\">http://www.britishathletics.org.uk/results/20160227_sheffield/timetable/index/index.html</a></p>\r\n<p></p>",

(official confirmation pending...)</p>\r\n<p>It is good to report there were four (yes, four!) women's teams entered covering the Senior, O40 and O50 races.

It's just past 9.15am and I am walking slowly towards the start line at this year&rsquo;s Brighton marathon. Others look nervous, some deep in concentration. I&rsquo;m among the many smiling; I&rsquo;m just, as they say, happy to be here.<br /><br />Seven years ago, on my 45th birthday, I ran my first ever half marathon. I was on hol.1 miles from home &ndash; and I&rsquo;d see if I could manage it back. I d. Athletics was not really for me: it was something others d, like Polo or Lawn Bowls. Then my daughter started running at Withdean for Phoenix. I'd always done a lot of sport - especially Sunday football &ndash; so rather than just sitting there waiting I ran round the track trying not to get in the way of those scary athletes. Then I started noticing some runners with waistlines like mine, speeds like mine, even running . <br /><br />I knew Paul through a mutual friend: 'er, Paul, can anyone join?' Yes, hop on the Phoenix bus and enjoy the r, he more or less replied. I&rsquo;ve written before (on his retirement from heading up the club) of my gratitude to him that he was not only personally encouraging but had created a club of members who were - and are - equally so. All of a sudden I found myself running with county champions, record holders and even national representatives. And not once d. It's been all smiles and warm welcomes. I started doing 10kms then halfs and then in 2013 thought I'd try the big one - the marathon. I'd day-dreamed that maybe one day - in New York, Prague or Rome - somewhere exotic - I'd maybe try it just once. But a friend d. I was persuaded. <br /><br />I have a flexible but heavy workload but I d. I was thrilled when I crossed the line in 3 hours 58 minutes and 57 seconds. I ran straight up the stairs to my friend&rsquo;s car and was driven to Wembley to see an FA cup semi-final. I felt great and barely tired. I had the bug. I went again the following year hoping for 3-45. I&rsquo;d earlier that year run a pb half of 1 hour 35&rsquo; and I had heard about doubling it and adding twenty minutess to get your marathon time. Was 3 hours 30&rsquo; really realistic? Surely not. <br /><br />On the day in 2014 I went for 3 hours 45&rsquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t pretty. I was so slow out of Preston Park, and then endlessly trying to catch up lost time. The second half was just a slog, getting slower and slower. I crossed the line in 3 hrs 53&rsquo; and I d't feel so great that time&hellip;.. But nevertheless I signed up once again. I was now time-motivated&hellip;I wanted that 3 hours 45&rsquo; . But things d't go well: work prevented proper training but worse followed in February 2016 when I foolishly came straight off a plane to a wintry Monday lunchtime run and damaged my Achilles. I won't bore you with the details but it stopped me running in March and made me defer the marathon. I'd started running the Sussex Grand Prix and I made it through ten races but always in some discomfort. Both achilles and now calves simply would not repair. And this was where I was in October 2015, a couple of weeks before I was due to start marathon training. I was sure I&rsquo;d have to postpone again. <br /><br />Then I had a bit of luck. I'd been getting physio that had predominantly meant acupuncture on my legs. It helped enough to allow me to run in the Grand Prix races (which I really enjoyed) but there was no overall improvement. Then my physio left Brighton. I asked around and was recommended a fellow Phoenix runner who was also a physio: Tobias Bremer. Almost the first thing I sa. Just concentrate on physio and rest. Nonsense, he replied - that is the complete opposite of what is needed. You need to strengthen your achilles to repair them. Thus I found myself emailing Andy Bone for a marathon &lsquo;plan&rsquo; &ndash; a 20-week schedule of runs that one is expected to try to do. <br /><br />Andy&rsquo;s plan arrived by email. What?? 42 miles in the first week? I&rsquo;ve never run 42 miles in a week ever! Yes, welcome to Andy Bone&rsquo;s multicoloured training plan. Long runs, tempo runs, speedwork, steady &hellip; Week 1 I managed 19 miles, week 2 I managed another 19. I was going to have to up my game but my achilles and calves were not up to it. Right, I sa, Christmas has to be make or break. Week three and I got to 37 miles out of 46. Then, even while ski-ing, I managed 22 out of 45&hellip; and I was really enjoying it. I could feel my lower legs getting stronger. Running on snow certainly helped. Over New Year&rsquo;s I hit a milestone: my first ever 50+ miles in a week. I tried to make every session &ndash; I tried to complete something: I can be guilty of not seeing things through but I was determined. I kept saying to myself to organize work around the running not the more normal other way around. Needless to say I started to understand why we have a number of freelance designers in the club. They work as hard as anyone, I&rsquo;m sure, but they &ndash; like me &ndash; can vary their schedules. <br /><br />I kept at it &ndash; 37, 47, 35 miles. But then after a wet, cold 20 mile run with Phoenix buddies on a Saturday morning I got the worst cold I can remember. I couldn&rsquo;t shift it for two weeks. It hit me just when I had early mornings, long flights, long days &ndash; and I got worse and worse. I certainly couldn&rsquo;t run. Half way through came the Brighton half. I was keen to run it as I felt sure, with all these miles run, I could break my 1 hour 35 pb. I felt OK at the start line but nothing went well. I had music with me &ndash; that failed after a kilometer. I had snuck into the sub 1 hour 30&rsquo; corral at the start &ndash; that was a mistake as they all disappeared from the off&hellip; And then I d&rsquo;t notice any extra strength in my legs at all. It was just hard work. I pushed as hard as I could &ndash; but I was outs. I started to wonder if all the effort and early morning/evening runs were going to have any effect by April 17th. People sa&rsquo;d had &ndash; I wasn&rsquo;t so sure.<br /><br />I redoubled my efforts. I couldn&rsquo;t run the Hastings Half as I&rsquo;d planned as my cold had come back. But then I got back on track: 34 miles, 36 miles, 53 miles. In total over the 20 weeks I&rsquo;d done six 20-milers (and up to that point I&rsquo;d only done one plus the two marathons in my entire life). What I wasn&rsquo;t doing enough of though was the speed work or any real gym work (&ldquo;on your core&rdquo; as they say). And I certainly found it all but impossible to run at pace on those long runs. Andy had set me a plan to try to achieve 3-30 that he felt I was capable of or should aim for at least. That meant a pace of 5&rsquo;/km or 8&rsquo;/mile. That was too fast for me &ndash; I managed one session of ten miles but only because it was with some of the great runners I run with at the weekend &ndash; and I was determined to stay with them at my marathon pace (their warm-up pace!) all the way to Worthing. I d, slow run back. <br /><br />But I had already won the race as far as I was concerned as finally my achilles problem was fading. A year with an injury is a long time - I hated the ache every time I went down stairs. Yet it was repairing. Even a twenty mile run up and down the South Downs Way was relatively easy now. The weekend before the marathon I ran at Christ&rsquo;s Hospital in the road relays. I had no &rsquo;d do &ndash; and I hadn&rsquo;t been training for short fast runs &ndash; but I was pleased to run 3km in well under 12 minutes. (My real ambition in life is a sub-20&rsquo; 5km&hellip;). A few days later &ndash; after a wonderful week eating pasta every day &ndash; and I was at the start line.<br /><br />We&rsquo;re off! Well not really&hellip;it takes ten minutes to actually reach the start line&hellip;and then we&rsquo;re off. Pace yourself, Tobias had sa. Try to do every mile at the same pace&hellip;which actually was something over 8&rsquo; miles &ndash; as my realistic aim wasn&rsquo;t 3 hours 30&rsquo; but to knock 8 minutes off my pb and break 3 hours 45&rsquo;. I later learnt I had the slowest start of any 45-54 year old. My first mile was 8&rsquo;51. Some in Phoenix would have run two miles in that time! But that&rsquo;s what I love about Phoenix: it&rsquo;s a broad church. Gradually I upped the speed &ndash; and then actually started to restrict my pace. Soon though I felt so comfortable at just under 8&rsquo; miles that I dec. And there was no-one more surprised than me that 20 miles later I was still running at just over a 3 hours 30&rsquo; pace&hellip; with absolutely no twinge or ache from achilles or calves. Twenty miles under my belt and it had gone well. I absolutely loved the crowds, the views, the weather &ndash; and, above all, family, friends and fellow Phoenix runners (both running and watching) cheering me on. <br /><br />It was about now I turned into Basin Road. There was a bit of headwind and it was here my thighs started getting tired. It was here that maybe the lack of gym work (and other sports which I&rsquo;d all but stopped due to lack of time) showed. Gradually my thighs &ndash; especially just above the knees &ndash; started to complain and edge towards cramp. I had to grit my teeth now and try to concentrate on keeping my back straight and arms moving close to my body. I actually like that run out to the Power Station so I kept telling myself that I was enjoying myself but it was only half true. I would have loved to have felt comfortable all the way back to the pier but that d&rsquo;t quite happen. My pace dropped but not disasterously&hellip;and I knew now I was going to get pb unless I cramped (which I&rsquo;ve never done in any race thankfully). I knocked myself out with a little sprint in the end &ndash; which to me felt quick and on the v&ndash; and crossed the line on 3 hours 35 minutes and 32 seconds. It wouldn&rsquo;t have looked like it at that moment but I could not have been happier.

In club terms he has now passed Mark Rowland 3:52.9 mile to move 2nd on our all time list. He sits behind Ovett's 3:48 mile which is our club record and was the world record....for just one day only!<br /><br />After his race he was world number 1 at the mile for just half an hour or so until the main (Bowerman) mile raced. He is, however, ranked 4th in the world over the mile after the weekend. <br /><br />With the Olympics looming, his timing couldn't be better.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://eugene.diamondleague.com/program_results_eugene/\">Results</a></p>\r\n<p>Photo: Craig Mitchelldyer/Getty Images</p>",

Read on for what went on up the Downs...</p>\r\n<p><br /><span ><strong>Phoenix Fox</strong></span><br />The women this year started with 8 who wanted to run the relay. With 6 places it seemed to be a case of all training and waiting to see who was still fit to run by June. However, as the time approached all 8 were literally still in the running. Luckily (for us) because of the issues with the men's teams being short of a runner Anita Jones bravely stepped up to join the phoenix B team whilst Deb Fris kindly volunteered to be reserve runner and so the Women's team was agreed: Liz Hall(Captain and savant in time predictions), Erica Martin, Caz Garrat, Hannah Carey, Bobby Searle and Kathryn Harnett with Hildi Mitchell kindly offering her driving skills.</p>\r\n<p><br />There is such an air of unpredictability about this race that adds to the excitement and this year d't disappoint; the day started with a sighting of a fox with a beer can in its mouth, saw about 200 cows bring leg 11 to a temporary stand still and ended with a nonchalant, white stallion trying to race the runners (see picture below for photographic ev). And had it not been for Hildi's patience and driving skills the leg 10 to 11 handover would have been missed due to the bottleneck of buses trying to leave Springhead Hill.</p>\r\n<p><br />As for the running; Erica led the women in leg 1 handing the baton to Bobby for leg 2, preceded by Liz, Hannah, Kathryn and Caz. As the race progressed we knew we had been overtaken by Arena 80 but it was hard to know where our position in the overall race was so our goal became not letting the Phoenix B team overtake us! By leg 7 we were seeing the B team arrive as were departing and even had the pleasure of giving B team-mate Richard a lift to ensure he met his handover (hope he's not too scarred!) but happily they never caught us.</p>\r\n<p>As far as club records go, Erica beat her previous record on leg 1(a) and Hannah beat the long held record on leg 10, previously held by Gemma Sharp from the Team of 2002. Well done to Bobby and Hannah for completing their first relays and for Caz for running the relay only 6 days after posting a brilliant time in the 32 mile Weald Challenge. Although we d't beat any other indiv, as a team we smashed our previous best over this course by 5 minutes and 33 seconds to finish in a time of 13:33:55 and an overall position of 7th. T</p>\r\n<p>he women's team should feel very proud of this achievement. Here's to next year.....</p>\r\n<p><em>Kathryn </em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Alex was followed by Jim Whitelegg on leg 3 who also kindly joined the team as a late replacement. <br />As we waited for Jim's arrival at the end of Leg 3 it had become apparent that James was struggling to weight bear on his foot after twisting an ankle on Leg 1 and it was increasingly looking that he may have to pull out. Jim came in to pass the batten onto SDWR debutant Mark Cossey for leg 4 and we headed for the start of leg 5 deep in discussion as to whether we should call it a day after the first 6 legs or carry on as a 5. In any event we still had 2 legs to run and potential records to be taken so Jose Luceron took the batten from Mark at the start of Leg 5 with that very goal in mind.<br />So it was onto Ditchling Beacon for what was potentially our last leg of the day and, as per tradition, a band of Our Supporters from the Phoenix family were there to prov.<br />Jose, swiftly arrived at the Beacon having successfully taken the senior record for his leg and Donald Maclellan set off for saddlescombe on Leg 6 not knowing whether this was to be it for the day. Buoyed by a good run on Leg 6 where he broke the Vet's record, Donald, was keen to continue and after a vote at saddlescombe it was unanimous that we would carry on as 5 runners but no longer in the official race. We left a disappointed James at Saddlescombe in the safe care of Liz, his physio wife and continued on our way.<br />We had earlier thought our race was over and in official terms it was but the situation engendered a new dynamic. We were now running free, racing across the Downs with wild abandon no longer truly bound by officialdom. We had become like Caballo Blanco! <br />By legs 15 we were now back in the thick of the runners and as fate may have it we caught up with the Phoenix B team at legs 16/17 and the pre race banter of overtaking them on leg 18 was becoming a real possibility. Our Spanish Missile, Jose, d's leaving Donald a bit less to do in catching Anita on the last leg which he duly d, breaking another Vet record! <br />Our decision to continue racing without a full team brought a mixture of bewilderment and appreciation from teams we ran with. We had initially thought it crazy ourselves but when you remove the tension it seems you really can run free!</p>\r\n<p><em>Thanks you Donald for this report</em></p>",

The current was very strong but surprisingly I felt ok despite not feeling like I was making any progress most of the time!</p>\r\n<p><br />The bike went out on an undulating loop around Beachy Head. The return route was a very enjoyable downhill followed by a nice flat loop along the seafront.</p>\r\n<p>The run took us up to the top of (similar to the start of the Beachy Head Marathon) which was pretty tough. The second half was all brought us back down the hill to finish along the seafront.</p>\r\n<p><br />I think some of my timings were wrong as for some reason my chip d't register the run or the bike splits. I gave them my bike time and they made up my run time which was much SLOWER than I actually got (they took it off my T2 time- I would never be that quick) so my actual times were as follows:</p>\r\n<p>Swim - 12:51<br />T1 - 3:55<br />Bike - 55:42<br />T2 - 1:10<br />Run - 21:54<br />Overall - 1:35:34</p>\r\n<p><br />This was a great race, well organised, challenging and local.

After 2 legs we were in a decent overall lead over 2nd team Brighton tri thanks to good running from Tobias and Matt. The lead was maintained by James and Donald and on the final leg and it appeared we were \"home and dry\" However Brighton tri had different . It was not apparent this was the case ( at least not me) but by the time we reached the zig zag ramp at the marina they were snapping at our heels like a pack of wolves! The race was truly on however the team motto of \"we are Steve Ovett\" meant there would only be one winner and as we took the 2nd last bend we stretched away from the \"wolves\" and all crossed the line with a comfortable margin. By this point the heavens had opened but then it came down in biblical proportions drenching us all. It cleared in time for us to gratefully accept our winning jog shop vouchers from Sam and his team before retreating to the pub for a celebratory drink!</p>\r\n<p><br />Social Secretary, <strong>Zeina Clare</strong> adds &lsquo;it was a good turn out for both the race and the social afterwards. Lots of drying off under hand driers in the toilets and people wandering around barefoot whilst draining shoes!!'</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

In our lane the drills such as swimming with your legs tied together to improve your posture in the water brought on the joke of drowning moths rather than the butterfly, but it was unanimously agreed how much we benefited from the session; not only were we pushed to swim harder but we were coached on how to achieve this.</p>\r\n<p>There was also the opportunity to be filmed swimming to analyse your technique and the session ended with a staggered race - like an amphibian blackcap handicap! Hildi had even thoughtfully brought hot drinks to keep us warm.</p>\r\n<p><br />Thank you so much to Hildi, Nigel and Jon who gave up their time to organise the sessions and prov.</p>",

It was somehow fitting that an odyssey that started way back in 1983 should reach this milestone right on my doorstep. It meant that friends and family came along and made the occasion even more special. On my journey there have been sub-3s and plus-4s but no dnf's fortunately. My pb is 2:44 and my pw is constantly being rewritten! I've accumulated a vast store of memorable moments and a small army of running friends that keep me royally entertained with their trials and tribulations.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>There was no plan to go for the hundred until two years ago when I quit ultras with a dodgy knee. By that time I was running trail marathons with my dog Butch and he joined me for 19 of the 27 marathons still needed to bring up the ton.</p>\r\n<p>I'm now surplus to requirements for the very talented Phoenix over 60s team, so I'm delighted to be heading into the twilight of my career just running with Butch whether it's training, parkrun, canicross or trail marathons.</p>\r\n<p>Happy running everybody, go Phoenix!\"</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

When I signed up for Ironman Vichy last year instead of a rush of excitement I felt fear and dread. It's huge, whichever which way you break it down it is just huge.</p>\r\n<p><br />Almost two years ago I sa, courageous, funny, positive and optimistic friend, Sandra. I always sa. Well, this was it - an IRONMAN.  I trained hard and dare I say it started to feel excited. I felt if I could show just a small amount of the strength that Sandra showed I would be just fine.\"</p>\r\n<p><br />Taking part in Vichy, France, Athletes swim 3.8km in the Lake Allier, cycle 180km through the regions of Allier and Puy-de-dome and finish with a 42.2km run on the shores of Lac d-Allier. Offering 40 qualifying slots for the 2017 Ironman world championships in Kona, Hawaii there was everything to race for!</p>\r\n<p><br />\"On Sunday 28th August I proved to myself that with the right training, focus, commitment and belief anything really is possible. In fact I exceeded my expectations finishing 2nd in my age group with a time of 11:15:38. I now have to do it all again at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii in October 2017! This time I am excited. As a triathlete there is no bigger honour than gaining a Kona slot.<br />Thanks also to my fantastic group of friends and all those who donated. I have nearly reached the &pound;1000, 17% of the cost of Sandra's care for the Martlets.\"</p>\r\n<p><em>Thank you Anita for this report</em></p>\r\n<p><em></em><br />If you would like to donate there is still time:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/Sandra-D\">https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/Sandra-D</a></p>\r\n<p>Full results:<br /><a href=\"http://eu.ironman.com/triathlon/coverage/athletetracker.aspx?race=vichy&amp;y=2016#axzz4IkgxXZDj\">http://eu.ironman.com/triathlon/coverage/athletetracker.aspx?race=vichy&amp;y=2016#axzz4IkgxXZDj</a></p>",

His pb at Hove came only a few months ago when he ran an impressive 19:50.<br /><br />He can be spotted at any of the local park runs and occasionally further afield.

Although not confirmed until after Christmas some careful number crunching by Paul Whelpton has revealed the following......</p>\r\n<p><strong><span >FULL (provisional!) list of medals:</span></strong><br /><strong>Senior Team Gold</strong>:Will, Malcolm, Andrew H, Andy N, Phil , Steve, Paul  Weir, Paul Wh, Tobias, Nigel <br /><strong>Vet Team Silver:</strong> Paul Wh, Nigel, Phil, Steve, Andy N</p>\r\n<p><strong>Indiv</strong><br />Overall (medals for top 20) Paul Weir (7th) Tobias (10th) Paul Wh (15th) Nigel (20th)</p>\r\n<p>V3 Nigel (3rd) V5 Paul Wh (1st) V6 Malcolm (2nd) V7 Andrew H (1st) <br />Izzy A (overall 13th, Senior 2nd)</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>Report</strong></p>\r\n<p>Despite losing three key runners, including captain Lance Bellers, to injury in the course of the season, Phoenix still d, so what is the key to the success? Paul Whelpton gives us his thoughts;<br />- in Senior competition is strength in depth, you need ten runners to score well over the whole season, we overhauled second placed Haywards Heath despite them having  some very good runners including three who were well ahead  of all of our team in the indiv.<br />- we had one of the oldest teams in the Senior Mens competition - seven of our scoring ten were Vets including three over 60s.<br />- our oldest runner V70 Andrew Haig clocked up 11 races and won his age category by a country mile despite undergoing foot surgery m<br />- towards the end of the season injuries and other problems left us relying on the bare minimum of ten runners for the last few races <br />- 19-year old Will Russell ran spectacularly well over the last five races, ending the season by knocking three minutes off his previous year's time in the final race of the season - the Crowborough 10k</p>\r\n<p>So what about next year? Well, Lance Bellers will stay Phoenix rep for the overall series but we will also have two new Senior reps in Paul Weir for the Senior men and Izzy Anderson for the Senior Women. We have made some progress this year in the seniors but would love to build on that in 2017, particularly the women who were only missing in quantity not quality this year.</p>\r\n<p>What do athletes need to do? Phoenix need as many male and female runners as possible to help the team (and potentially win themselves a medal) by planning well ahead and clocking up an effective number of races next year - which means at least 8 races including at least two long ones (10 miles or more). Please feel free to speak to Lance, Paul, Izzy, Paul or anyone else who took part if you have any questions about how to go about it, advice on indiv.</p>\r\n<p>Happy running!</p>\r\n<p><em>Thank you Paul &amp; Lance for your info for this report</em></p>",

Awards Night is a celebration for all members of the club and a chance for us to get together and show our appreciation towards all committed members of the club; no one should feel they are not in the running for an award simply because they are not the quickest in their age category, dedication and other factors also come into play for most of the awards. The Board are aware that there has been a lack of clarity over what you need to do to win a 'gong' and we hope this will help people understand what is required and create healthy competition within each category. We are also reviewing all aspects of the organisation of Awards Night so feel free to submit any compliments, criticisms and suggestions!

The races started with the girls U11's with the Phoenix only runner Mekdes Berry finishing in a good 9th place. The U11 boys followed with both William Muzio matching Mekdes in finishing in 9th and Matthew Noakes just behind him in 14th place.</p>\r\n<p><br />In the U13 girls unfortunately Emily Muzio was tripped in the mass start but d. Her sister Ciara was the first Phoenix runner home, going one better than Mekdses and William to finish in 8th place with Taya Gilbert completing the team finishing in 38th place.</p>\r\n<p><br />It was the U13 Boys that prov. He was followed by Joe Checkley in 18th, Sam Checkley in 24th, Cassius Hebden in 34th and Eddie Harrison in 37th.</p>\r\n<p><br />The U15 girls prov. Alice was followed by Rachell Berry in 10th, Mia Edwards in 15th and Madelaine Parmar in 23rd, with the team securing the first team medal of the day for Phoenix with bronze.</p>\r\n<p><br />The first indiv. Unfortunately the only other Phoenix competitor Zach Ebden had to retire after turning his ankle but well done to Zach for making the effort to go to Bexhill.</p>\r\n<p><br />Phoenix were now on a roll and in the next race the U17 girls prov. The team were led home by Almi Nerurkar who like Leo controlled the race from the start. Almi waited a little longer than Leo before breaking away from the leading group, which included Naomi Fonteyn who just missed out on the bronze medal in the run to the line but had a fine run to finish 4th. Connie Jankowski completed the gold medal team finishing in 13th place. Unfortunately Anna Berry and Holly Luscombe were unable to finish the race but should be commended for starting the race.</p>\r\n<p><br />There were no Phoenix starters in the U17 boys race, which is the first time for many years. Given the numbers of juniors at training at Phoenix every week, the turn out for the county's most important x-country race was disappointing, hopefully next year this can be rectified. However this should not distract from those who made the trip to Bexhill and who all tried their best and should be commended.</p>\r\n<p><br />It was a case of men before ladies with the senior men's race being next. The senior men's race also included the U20 men's race, with the U20's running 3 of the 4 laps run by the senior men. At the end of these 3 laps it was Dan St, leading the other U20 runners from start to finish. Billy White moved through strongly on the last lap to take the U20 silver medal. Meanwhile at the front of the field in the senior race Jon Pepper broke away from the leading group to win the 4th indiv, this was Jon's 5th senior title. In the race for the other medals Max Dumbrell was having a good run but just missed out in a three-way sprint to the line to finish in 4th place. Despite many Phoenix athletes being absent those present all ran well with Patrick Acaye 16th, Darryl Hards 20th, Sean Parker Harding 37th and Donald Maclellan 38th completing the Phoenix team that finished with the bronze medal. Next home for Phoenix were Alex Cruttenden 45th, Jonny McCormack 47th, Paul Weir 49th, Ash Dorrington 54th Austen Hunter 63rd.</p>\r\n<p><br />It was the ladies who finished the days racing. As with the men the U20's ran with the seniors but unlike the men the U20 women ran the same distance as the seniors making it difficult to work out positions. Tara Bage who has been running well dec's she was fighting it out at the front of the field with the top 10 seniors. Unfortunately, Tara faded towards the end of the race and was just beaten into silver medal position in the u20 race but still had a fine race finishing 12th overall and should be commended for her bravery. Just behind Tara was the first senior Erica Martin who finished in 15th and d. Erica was followed by Carroline Garrett 43rd, Isobel Anderson 50th, Sarah Russell 61st and Lucinda Ganpatsingh 65th.<br />Well done all those who ran.</p>\r\n<p>Let's see more Phoenix white vests competing in the last x-country league race at Hickstead on 11th February.</p>\r\n<p><em>Thanks to Bruce for this report</em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

All the races included a few laps of this course so the key was to not over cook the first hill!</p>\r\n<p><br />First off were the 050 and 60 men. Completing a 5 mile course it was Paul Whelpton who deserves a mention for finishing 2nd 060, 8th overall in a storming 33.34.

Dave Carter was the fastest Phoenix man, finishing 7th overall. They took 3rd and 8th in the team standings.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to Erica and Andrew for the photography</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sussexathletics.net/2017\">http://www.sussexathletics.net/2017</a></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Despite a new course starting at the Goodwood Aerodrome (not universally appreciated) and a long delay before the gun was fired leaving athletes shivering in the cold, Finn ran a cool commanding race. He finished looking fresh as a daisy a good 70M ahead of his nearest rival. His time? A remarkable 30:46. There were a handful of other PHoenix runners among the 1700 fiinishers and again you can see full details on the <a href=\"../../../results\">results page</a></p>\r\n<p>Well done both</p>",

For instance we already have a lot of members staking strong bfor 2017 team awards:</p>\r\n<p>Under 11 Boys XC Team: best turnout of any of our teams in the Sussex Cross Country League;</p>\r\n<p>Women's XC Team: bronze medallists in Sussex Cross Country League in their first year after promotion to Division 1;</p>\r\n<p>Men's Sussex Grand Prix Team: winners of the SGP Men's Trophy for the first time.</p>\r\n<p><em>Awards are not the be all and end all of why we run of course, but who doesn't like a bit of recognition, so best of luck to all!</em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

In a field of 1762 finishers Jon was closely followed by Max Dumbrell who had a very good top 100 finish in 84th then by Max Pickard in 143rd and Austen Hunter 770th . Max P and Austen both d.

Read on for Alex Bonzi's report....</p>\r\n<p>\" With no mention of any further named weather phenomena to follow on the heels of storm Ewan, entrants to the Eastbourne half marathon would have been forgiven to have thought surely, surely, conditions were not going to be as bad as they were for Brighton's?!?! I don't know if this might have angered the weather gods but, as it happened, it was very much the case of &lsquo;better the devil (storm) you know' as strong winds and squally rain welcomed the roughly 1500 plucky runners for the, oh-so-civilised, 10 am start.<br />At least, the relatively mild temperatures prov.  These were the thoughts going through my mind together with reminding myself of the training I had done as I was trying to keep warm while waiting for the start in a muddy Princes Park located at the east end of the seafront.<br /> <br />Finally 10 o'clock struck ( actually...we were held for a few tens of seconds longer- how ironic and cruel!) and we set off westward along the esplanade. As we settled in our pace past the seafront sights, the Pier, the Grand Hotel a meowing, leather-clad, whip-cracking cat woman (!?!?), the incline started to become noticeable under our feet: the feeling received its visual confirmation as soon as the course turned away from the coast where the climb up Warren hill begun in earnest.  Climbing was testing: the climb long and the gradient demanding but at least away from the wind! Even this early in the race ( miles 3 and 4) I was glad I d, I am sure, I would have been made to pay dearly.  After a sharp turn at the top ( which in my estimation was at the same height as the not so distant Beachy Head) we were released to what felt like after the struggles of the climb, hurtle headlong along sweeping hairpin bends as the course wound its way back to the seafront.   <br /> <br />Once on the seafront we quickly descended at sea level along the promenade: finally with the wind at our backs we got down to the serious business of notching off the miles!  5,6,7,8 came and went.  By now even the sun was tim! Eventually we arrived at the harbour at the opposite end of the seafront. Here the course became really technical: it twisted its way past res, over br, along gravely paths. What it lacked in speed it certainly made in variety!!<br /> <br />As we eventually found our way back onto the seafront for the last two miles, one would have been forgiven to allow the mind to wonder towards thoughts of finishing. For those that d, there was to be one last surprise in store: a stretch of exposed land, running directly into the wind path back to the Princes park! With the wind seemingly saving its best (worst) for this and with legs aching at every step it was a gruelling test of mental fortitude.  Eventually even this came to an end and, via a couple of short zig zags we reached the finish and the well-earned medal!<br /> <br />There was a good Phoenix turnout especially in the women's category with 15 runners, 9 of them women (compared with 2 last year).  This is particularly valuable as it qualifies as a SGP race!</p>\r\n<p>The race was not one for a quick time but impeccably run, enjoyable in its variety and well supported by the locals (cat woman making an appearance was a definite bonus!!!).  I will definitely cons!\"</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em>Thanks again Alex for this report</em></p>\r\n<p><em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/results/Eastbourne%20Half%20Marathon/2525\">https://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/results/Eastbourne%20Half%20Marathon/2525</a></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Who&rsquo;s a Cross Country Club Now?!&rdquo;</h3>\r\n<p>Sad news came to the club recently. <strong>Maurice D&rsquo;Arienzo</strong>, truly one of the club&rsquo;s Founding Fathers passed away suddenly. We all know the story of how Matt Paterson and Steve Ovett formed Phoenix back in 1981. They lit the fire but without a couple of key families rolling up their sleaves and commiting to Phoenix the club would not have succeeded. Key amongst those familes where the D&rsquo;Arienzo&rsquo;s. Maurice and Sylvia were such a warm and welcoming couple with three children, Susanna, Ronnie and Simonetta. I for one will never forget how they welcomed me into the club when I arrived in Brighton as a young art student. <br /><br />Italian born Maurice had a glint in his eye and a smile on his face that made any time with him fun and memorable. He became the second Chairman of Phoenix and he even made board meetings fun. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him. <br /><br />Upon hearing the news about Maurice Steve Ovett has sent this message. <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always remember Maurice as someone who always had a smile on his face and laughter even when Ronnie had a bad race ! <br /><br />He loved sport and his family, and when they combined you could see in his eyes he was at his happiest. <br /><br />Another thing I remember was he was very light on his feet !! <br /><br />Almost silent as he jogged around, we just got him too late in Phoenix I think he had the making of a challenger to Paterson ! <br /><br />I always think that in the passing of someone we should look back and see if they enjoyed their brief stay here with us, in my mind Maurice certainly d.&rdquo; <br /><br />Now you may well wonder why this obituary has the title it does. It relates to an event that has become somewhat legendary. In the early days of Phoenix we were not cons. Why would you be if you were founded by the Olympic 800m champion and your club 1500m and Mile records were world records? Yes you can see why we were all puzzled by this attitude! The Sussex Track and Field championships used to hold a 4x 400m championship as the last event. One year Phoenix dec. Upon arriving at the old Crawley stadium the Phoenix clan were greated with some disdain. A rival team approached them and sa&ldquo;Why are you bothering to put out at team you&rsquo;re just a cross country club.&rdquo; Emotions were high and the race was close but the Phoenix team of Mark Rowland, Steve Ovett, Dave Agnew and Ronnie D&rsquo;Arienzo triumphed crossing the line in a new Championship record. Maurice promptly marched over to the rival team and called up to them &ldquo;Hey! Who&rsquo;s a Cross Country Club Now?!&rdquo; As I sa. But Maurice knew that he had to say what he sa. Maurice stepped up to the mark for Phoenix in so many ways. He was not only a Chairman but also a coach, a team manager, a Father and a life long supporter. He will be missed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Paul Collicutt</strong></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Maurice is survived by Ronnie and Simonetta and they have asked us to share the notice below.</p>\r\n<p>Please help us celebrate Dad&rsquo;s life. The funeral service at is on Tuesday 21 March at 1pm in the North Chapel at Woodvale Crematorium, followed by a 2:15 burial at the Lawn Memorial Cemetery (Warren Road). Friends and family are also invited to a gathering afterwards. <br /><br />If you wish, flowers would be lovely or a donation to the Sussex Wildlife Trust where Dad volunteered would be appreciated. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/Simonetta-D-Arienzo-Cole1\">https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/Simonetta-D-Arienzo-Cole1</a> <br />Chalcraft Funeral Directors will be accepting floral tributes. <br />Their address is Chequers Yard, Steyning, BN44 3RE. <br /><br />We are bound to have missed friends, so please pass on the invite to all that would like to attend.</p>",

There are hills from quite near the start, some short sharp ones, one long steady one and several others along the way.  If you're like me this prov!</p>\r\n<p><br />I started my race well and had some company for some of the first 4 miles but my running mate for the long drag up to Mile 5 must have expended all his energy and I was then on my own. However, as anyone who has run this race will testify, you never feel alone at the Hastings Half such is the great support from the whole community at every point on the course. <br />So despite the lack of running company, I was spurred on to close the gap to those ahead. Thanks to the downhill section that took us back on to the prom I caught up with the 2 guys that I had in my sights for most of the race. This I thought may be useful as the ferocity of the wind was now really apparent as we ploughed onto the finish line along the prom. I exchanged some motivational words with my new running companions as one does in dire situations but despite my enthusiastic words for the battle that lay ahead they soon edged away from me so it was just me against the wind for the final onslaught.  The finish line finally came and I was thankful to be home. With the meaty Horse brass finishers medal in my possession I retreated to the shelter of the tent to await the rest of the team, eager to hear of their race experience.</p>\r\n<p><br />A week after the race it was a pleasant surprise to receive an email from the race organiser to say we had won a prize for 3rd place vet team so Mark Cossey, Steve Selby  Paul Wishart and I look forward to receiving our unexpected award at the prize giving on Easter weekend. Mark will be going to accept the honour so photos please Mark. Well done team and all that battled the course on the windiest day in the race's History.</p>\r\n<p><em>Thank you Donald Maclellan for this report</em></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/results/Main%20Event/2239\">https://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/results/Main%20Event/2239</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

The U15 girls team of Maia, Rachel Berry and Milly Dickinson finished second overall.</p>\r\n<p>With 6 women's and 2 girls teams entered this year the Phoenix women's resurgence continues!</p>\r\n<p>The Senior men's A team of Max Packard, Spencer Thomas, Charlie Grice, Jon Pepper, Josh Guilmant and Billy White took gold for the 7th year running with Charlie Grice and Spencer Thomas ran 1st &amp; 2nd legs fastest legs. The senior men's B team of Dan Str, Pat Acaye, Declan Neary, Sean Parker-Harding, James Miles and Oliver Johnson finished third as d's team of Malcolm Kemp, Andrew Haig and Paul Whelpton, with Paul taking second fastest lap - not bad for a team with an average of age of 69!</p>\r\n<p>Thanks also to Colin Simpson, Lance Bellers, Matt Greenall, Jon Pepper, Jacqueline Swift and Bobby Searle for team captain duties, especially as not all of you could run.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://sussexraces.tripod.com/2017Results/2017AprSussexRelayResults.xls\">http://sussexraces.tripod.com/2017Results/2017AprSussexRelayResults.xls</a></p>",

The wind picked up a bit throughout the bike and 8 laps seemed to go on forever!<br />The second run passed quite quickly and overall I was pleased with how the race went and was impressed with how well organised everything was.\"</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://chiptimingsolutions.com/british-duathlon-championships-2017?tab=Race%20Results#1_94D641\">http://chiptimingsolutions.com/british-duathlon-championships-2017?tab=Race%20Results#1_94D641</a></p>",

          "content": "<p ><strong><span >Phoenix Athletes: Your Club needs YOU!</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Sunday saw the third race in the Sussex Grand Prix series with the Haywards Heath 10 mile. The Phoenix women were out in force with some spectacular performances with Bobby Searle, Caz Garrett and Hannah Carey claiming the Women's Team Prize and Zeina Clare putting in a gutsy performance despite a nasty fall. <br />There were many other outstanding performances at Haywards Heath, with four Phoenix men in the first 20 finishers (Paul Weir, Jonny McCormack, Alex Bonzi and James Miles), Andrew Haig knocking two minutes off his previous run at Haywards Heath to claim the V70 prize and Paul Whelpton finishing ahead of all the V50s.</p>\r\n<p><br />Alex Bonzi and Hannah Carey deserve special mention as they  both raced the East Grinstead 10-miler the previous day and still had something in the tank for the Burgess Hill 10k to complete the 3 races in the &lsquo;M' races.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Our top ten male runners at the Eastbourne Half averaged  around 465 points each, a total beaten by only one other team (the Seaford Str) on the day. Our turnout and points were lower at the Hastings Half with only 7 male scorers, but we bounced back at Haywards Heath last Sunday with (on our estimate) our 10 men averaging close to 475 points each, easily the best scoring male team on the day.  (We won the SGP Men's Title last year with an average score per runner per race of around 465 - based on our top ten men's 8 best races.) Women's turnout has been lower (Eastbourne 5 Hastings 1 Haywards Heath 9) so no useful average score data to scrutinise yet, though Haywards Heath scores will be good with 3 of our women scoring over 490.</p>\r\n<p>With only 3 of the 17 races gone, Phoenix are already looking a good bet to retain the Men's Title, and our women have a very strong chance of finishing amongst the medals if they can get 10 runners to complete 8 races.</p>\r\n<p>There will only be 11 SGP races left after the 3 May events ( May 7th Hastings 5-mile, 21st Horsham 10K and 28th Rye 10-mile).  Some of the races later in the year (including the Phoenix 10k) double as Sussex County Championship events so attract  especially large and high-quality fields which naturally makes high scores harder to achieve. So, anyone hoping to post 8 good scores (2 at least must be 10-mile races or longer) needs to get a few races under their belt by the end of May if at all possible. Horsham and Rye are especially good scorers.</p>\r\n<p>By the way...if 8 races is totally impossible for you don't give up! 6 or 7 races may still get you a place in the indiv.</p>\r\n<p><br />Contacts: Captains Bobby Searle and Paul Weir; SGP Reps Lance Bellers Izzy Anderson Paul Whelpton</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://niceworkevents.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/m.html\">http://niceworkevents.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/m.html</a></p>\r\n<p><em>Thanks Paul for this report &amp; Ross Webb &amp; Judith Mathews for the photos</em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

The race distances increased with each event, although all of them were weighted towards runners as the bike segments were relatively short. The events were all well organised and marshalled with chip timing giving instant results The runs were all on Southsea prom and early starts meant the roads were quiet for the bike. The first two were particularly windy days, but that added to the challenge. If you don't mind an early start  and a drive to Southsea, this is a good series to take part in, especially if you are a runner who can bike a bit\"</p>\r\n<p>Next year there is a series a month earlier - here's to Nigel's winter training ready for a February duathlon!</p>\r\n<p>Overall results<br />Race 1: 1:08:53: 5km run, 15km cycle, 5km run <br />Race 2: 1:28:10: 7.5km run 17.5km cycle 5km run<br />Race 3: 1:47:17: 10km run 24km cycle 5km run</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://racetimingsolutions.co.uk/Results/Portsmouth%20Duathlon%20Series%20Results%202017%20-%20HTML.html\">http://racetimingsolutions.co.uk/Results/Portsmouth%20Duathlon%20Series%20Results%202017%20-%20HTML.html</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

As it happens there was no need to worry as the team couldn't have been more welcoming. It was inspiring to run along s, Richard for finding the energy to run up Cocking Hill, Jim for his tips on running and hair management, Andy for replacing the replacement with only 2 days notice and Malcolm who had to manage last minute team changes from another county!  Thank you also to the amazing Louise who drove the bus with skill and stayed awake and lively to keep the conversation going all the way home!</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The day started out as a head to head race with the Phoenix women. We all agreed it really made the day having another team we knew to battle against on the Downs - one minute the B-team were leading, then next the women however we d&amp; keep it by the final few legs. The B-team were all within 5 minutes of their estimated times (except me who greatly underestimated my running speed!). We finished 15minutes under estimate, a whopping 20 minutes faster than last year. Here's wishing Phil &amp; Brian well who both, regrettably, had to pull out due to injury.</p>\r\n<p><em>Kathryn Harnett</em></p>\r\n<p><br /><span ><strong>Phoenix Women</strong></span><br />Women's Team Captain, Liz Hall<br />\"Well done 'Ladies' Team on our fastest time over this course 13:17:23 which is only 3 seconds outs.<br />Leg 1: Erica beat her own record by 10 seconds so it now sits at 49:49<br />Leg 3: Lizzy beat Caz's record by 36 seconds so it now sits at 33:57<br />Legs 7 &amp; 8 become new records by virtue of the course change<br />Leg 10: Hannah beat her own record by 5 seconds so it now sits at 27:27<br />Leg 11: Mel beat Emma Rollins 11 year record by 47 seconds so it now sits at 42:30<br />Leg 15: Lizzy beat Kathryn's record on the shorter leg 15 (can't quite remember when that came in) so it now stands at 34:07<br />Leg 17: Mel set a new record of 1:02:50. This is 3 seconds short of Emma's record but the course is now a little longer than when Emma set that time.</p>\r\n<p>For the purposes of a report on the day, it all went very smoothly and was great fun. There was talk of competition in relation to who ran nearest to the times I had predicted, who ran cumulatively faster than the prediction, who ran cumulatively closest, and anything else I can't remember. Well taking each leg in isolation Hannah ran within 3 seconds of the predicted time I gave her on leg 10, and Caz was a close second by running within 6 seconds of the prediction for leg 16. Taking a cumulative approach; Lizzy was closest being only 1:01 away from the predictions for all three added together and no one was far out, Mel cumulatively faster than the prediction by 3:55 which was the biggest variance and to be celebrated as it was in the right direction (i.e. quicker than predicted). Most important is that Hildi delivered us to each and every leg safely and in good time, complete with non-stop entertainment and bunting decorations.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong><span >Phoenix A team</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>\"After some excellent training sessions and strong race performances in the build-up to the relay we set out with high hopes and half an eye on breaking the 11 hour barrier. We had a 50:50 mix of old-hands (Matt, Tobias, Donald) and novices (Jonny, Tom, Paul) in the team and with the experienced Ro at the wheel we were able to rely on expert driving, navigation and recording of times through the day.</p>\r\n<p>As. This shouldn't detract from some brilliant racing and gutsy performances all round. Particular praise goes to Jonny McCormack for beating his overall target time (thus walking away with a cool &pound;12 in the sweepstake) and to Donald Maclellan for battling against the effects of a heavy cold throughout the day. As spectacular as the views were, and as enjoyable as the event was, it'll perhaps be hardest to forget the increasingly sinister whispers from the back of the van as he lost his voice...</p>\r\n<p>We crossed the line in 11:33:50. Thanks and well done to the whole team for their efforts not just on the day but in the build-up - it was great to have such a strong team ethic. It's a very tough event but a huge amount of fun with it - I certainly hope to be back for another go soon!\"</p>\r\n<p><em>Paul Weir</em></p>\r\n<p>Congratulations to the <strong>Phoenix Badgers</strong>who finished second in the race to break the course record - beat by stubbington Green by only 4 minutes.Times to follow when they are posted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>All those who ran would like to any a huge thank you to Matt for his role in promoting the event within the club and communicating with the organisers and to the intrep. Without you guys the run would not have happened.</strong></p>\r\n<p></p>",

          "content": "<p ><strong><span >Man v Horse</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Well done to Kevin Bramhill who finished 38th in the Man v Horse run in Wales:</p>\r\n<p>\"I am probably one of the slowest members of Phoenix judging by my rare Wednesday track performances where I'm normally last or thereabouts so taking on a race against horses might seem a bit futile. If you want to beat ALL the horses then, yes, you need to be fast to do that.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>My goals were:</p>\r\n<p>1)      make it to the start,</p>\r\n<p>2)      make it to the end,</p>\r\n<p>3)      bonus if I could beat at least one finishing horse.</p>\r\n<p>I'd looked at a set of results on Wikipedia and noticed that the last horse averaged around 14 minutes / mile. I figured that would be worth a shot to beat the last nag home!</p>\r\n<p>The format of the race is fairly simple. There's a mass human start at 11am. 15 minutes later the circa 60 horses (+ r) start. A person has beaten all the horses 3 times in the last 38 years. The horses can't cope with all the terrain that humans can so sometimes you're sharing tracks with them and other times they run a parallel part of the course. The theory is that, the hotter the weather, the slower the horses will be as they can't sweat much to cool off. Yesterday it rained in Wales all day so probably nice for the horses.</p>\r\n<p>What I thought would happen is that the horses would rap, wiz past and that would be the last I'd see of them. This was true, in my case, but only for the first 10 or so horses. After that you'd get a few horses catching up then you'd go past them and then they'd pass again. The horse pace varied a lot more than I'd imagined depending on the nature of the track so it was quite amazing to occasionally run next to a horse and even pass them here &amp; there.</p>\r\n<p>Training; I assumed it would be flaming June not June monsoon. I'm not sure how you can train for running in (anticipated) hotter weather when training on the downs in February but I tried running hotter than normal with an extra layer. It probably had no useful effect! Reading about the race I understood it to be about 23 miles with 3000 feet of ascent. I took a normal marathon plan and then added in hills so that I was up to roughly the 3000 feet on my long runs. This mostly involved going up &amp; down the paths along the North s.</p>\r\n<p>A couple of days before the event they released the route profile (attached picture) and it turned out that this year the route was 4600+ feet of ascent! Kind of a big difference and too late to add that into the plan. Actually I'm not sure that it would have made a huge difference to my plan as I think you have to add the hills in gradually and I was finding the hills I d.</p>\r\n<p>So, how'd I do? Well, I beat 5 finishing horses (+9 that d't make it all the way). In addition to solo runners like myself, there are also relay teams consisting of 3 people / team. I beat 21 relay teams. Overall I was 488th of 693 (including horses). Not bad for an aging ex-smoker if I say so myself. ...and if I can do that, clearly there's lot of opportunity for other club runners to do better!</p>\r\n<p>Will I do it again? Absolutely.\"</p>\r\n<p>Here's the results: <a href=\"https://resultsbase.net/event/4000/results?round=8678&amp;page=10\">https://resultsbase.net/event/4000/results?round=8678&amp;page=10</a></p>\r\n<p><em>Kevin Bramhill</em></p>",

Recent successes include 4th Vet at Falmer tri. She says:</p>\r\n<p>\"I have done the Arundel L(21 May) and Falmer Tri (9th July). I enjoyed both (both were sprint although Falmer had a longer bike route).</p>\r\n<p>Arundel L(but some good downhill bits as well) and an undulating run which had a bit of a sharp hill m.</p>\r\n<p>Falmer was hillier and Ditching Beacon is thrown in towards the end of the bike route which is a bit of a shock to the system if you haven't prepared yourself for it! Falmer sells itself as a good first time triathlon - I would say Arundel L(unless you really love a hilly bike route and a hilly run route).</p>\r\n<p>Lessons learnt<br />Both triathlons were pool triathlons - so important to place yourself in the correct time slot because if you end up swimming in a lane with slower swimmers you risk a slower time if they don't obey the swim rules of letting you pass.<br />If doing Falmer Triathlon - DO practice the Beacon at least once before the big day!<br />Falmer was really well marshalled - so although the instructions seemed really complicated there was plenty of help on the way to show  you where you were going (really big shout out to the 60 volunteers on the day!)<br />Great sunny weather for both races! <br />I need to do more bike training! :-)</p>\r\n<p>I was 10th female at Arundel and 14th Female at Falmer (I think - provisional results). It feels good to be doing Triathlon again - but it was nice to have a fellow Phoenix member at the last one (Falmer).\"</p>\r\n<p>Fellow team mate / competitor <strong>Bobby Searle</strong>, is the senior women's captain who has recently turned her running talents to triathlon. She has this to add:<br />\"Falmer triathlon was a great event, I would recommend it for others who like a few challenging hills. I had no (senior) as they d't call my name at the prize giving so it was a nice surprise!\"</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"../../results\">http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Other races I choose are often qualification races for the British age group team. To qualify for the British team you need to finish in the top 3 or 4 places in your age group depending on how many qualification races there are.<br />This year I entered the Leeds triathlon which is the first qualification race for the world championships on the Gold Coast in Australia in September 2018. I managed to come second in my age group and as this was also the BTF championships I got a silver medal and also a qualification place for Australia.<br />Ripon triathlon was the English championship where I got a bronze medal in my age group and as it was a qualification price for the world championships in Rotterdam this September I got a place on the team for that also.<br />It is quite a lot of traveling around the UK but I really enjoy competing for the GB team when I get a chance.\"</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"../../results\">http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results</a></p>",

I arrived off the train early on the Saturday afternoon and walked over to Gloucester Docks to pick up my number before checking out the first couple of miles of the race - nice flattish roads,no problem there, and the last couple - paths alongs, and with three kissing gates to negotiate. I wondered hopefully if they might unbolt and lift these off for the race? (They d&rsquo;t of course!). Later in the evening fish pie (in picturesque surroundings at Bills on Gloucester Quays next to the start line) was a pleasant but rash choice for the pre-race carb load, putting my digestive system under extra stress on top of the usual pre-race nerves and restless night; but I was up at 5.30 to make sure everything was under control before the race started!<br /><br />Bombed along for the first 7 or 8 miles on good flat roads feeling pretty good (actually ran the first 10k quicker than I managed at the Phoenix 10k last month against that pesky headwind!) but as usual slowed in the second half of the race - much of which was on picturesque but rough tracks and paths and not brilliantly marked/marshalled; narrowly avo. Plenty of brief words of friendly encouragement exchanged with other runners - though d kept calling me &lsquo;Sir&rsquo; presumably in recognition of my greying temples. Very glad I was prepared for the kissing gates in the last mile so they d&rsquo;t put me off my str, and managed to rally enough to finish more or less on target in around 1:25 - good enough I hope to take me to the top of the runbritain V65 UK rankings!Hopefully I&rsquo;ll manage to stay there a bit longer than the couple of days I lasted earlier this year in the V60s. But just in case I&rsquo;ve signed up for the Great Eastern Half in Peterborough in October to have another crack at it. <br /><br />Apart from the Phoenix factor I haven&rsquo;t the faintest &rsquo;ve run in my whole life have come in the last 18 months so big thanks!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Paul</strong></p>",

Phil Hampshire on the other hand was primarily a m, in a moment of madness, offered to accompany Malcolm on this epic run. <br /><br />Jane Edmonds had kindly offered to do all the support driving and partner Andrew Haig was there to offer encouragement and ribald comments to his training companions (OK, to be fair he d.)<br /><br />The big problem turned out to be the heat of the day and on the first two legs the boys took insufficient water with them. It's not easy to rectify that kind of deficit and I think the runners would agree that the whole thing was tough, tough tough. It d't help that we bumped into young Finn McNally doing effortless str. Phil was probably having the better of it in the latter stages whilst Malcolm's legs were threatening to cramp up and he had to adjust pace accordingly. Andrew had joined the run at Upper Beeding and spirits were raised when first Jon Wright and later Rick Taub appeared to accompany us to the end.<br /><br />There was a bit of a party atmosphere at Saddlescombe Farm too where we had arranged to meet support driver Jane doing a sterling job but were also cheered on by Linda, Jeanette, Sophie and baby Lily.</p>\r\n<p>Congratulations Malcolm &ndash;70K for your 70th.

To celebrate my 70th year I thought I needed a challenge and dec....1k for each year. So on Monday this week my trusty companion Phil Hampshire and I, driven by Jane Edmonds with Andrew Haig in support arrived at Harting Down car park at 8.30 pm to start our epic run to Stanmer Woods Car park via Ditchling Beacon. With my one and only longest preparation run of 2 hours 20 minutes completed the Sunday before we set off on a still, sunny morning with a light mist in the valley below.<br />As we progressed on our journey the sun began to reach temperatures of 25 degrees and the stoney paths proved hard work. The early legs (this run was 8 legs of the South Downs Relay) d't seem too bad as they weren't so familiar but as we got nearer to Brighton theenormity of our task began to dawn on us. After 24 miles the legs began to get heavy with19 miles still lo go.<br />Bit by bit we ticked off the distances with Andrew and Jane waiting atstrategic points along the way for refueling.<br />Penultimatelywe arrived at Devil's Dyke, where we were joined by Jon Wright and his dog and then Rik Taub at Pycombe. Finally Ditchling Beacon was reached just as the sun was setting before we started our descent down through Stanmer Woods to our final destination at Coldean Lane Car Park. 70k (43 miles) &ndash; mission accomplished!\"</em><br /><strong>Malcolm</strong><br /><br />\"I went through a stage of feeling awful to one of feeling terrible.

Lizzie Miles finished 5th senior woman with Izzy Anderson 8th.</p>\r\n<p>Paul Whelpton, Phoenix's own SGP statistician has crunched the numbers whilst the website is waiting to be updated. He says:<br />\"Definitely a spectacular victory for our men at Newick however you look at it:<br />Top 5 men from each club: Phoenix  average finishing place 7th, Wadhurst 16th, Hailsham 35th, Haywards Heath 39th<br />Top 10 men from each club: Phoenix 21st, Wadhurst 47th, Hailsham 71st, Haywards Heath 95th</p>\r\n<p>Women's result is much less clear. Not as many runners competed from each team, but if you look at the top six from each team at Newick, Haywards Heath come out on top with an average finishing place of 90th, and we come out second  with 105, just a nose ahead of the red hot favourites for the Women's Title Hailsham Harriers on 106.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of the overall Women's competition we are likely to need to finish in second place overall - after the last race at Crowborough -  to have a realistic chance of taking the overall SGP title.  Haywards Heath, Wadhurst and Crawley Saints and Sinners are our main rivals for second place in the Women's competition and my guess is it will be pretty close right up till the end.\"</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByJKIRtlfCsiemgtRlZGRFVBQ3c/view\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByJKIRtlfCsiemgtRlZGRFVBQ3c/view</a></p>",

Chatting to top British Pro Joe Skipper at breakfast he informed me the bike was a real &ldquo;hard mans&rdquo; bike.

Ninety degree turns at the bottom of steep hills led immediately to 12%</span><span>up</span><span>hills so whilst the views were spectacular there was never a moments rest during which to appreciate them.</span><span>The temperature was rising on the second lap which made the hills seem even harder. On the return to town we were encountering the standard race competitors, some of whom had ignored the race briefing to be careful on the descents and corners.

The volunteers and townsfolk were brillia</span><span>nt and kept us all going.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Finally the last lap was ticked off and I entered the town square for the last time to generous applause and energetic cheerleaders.

          "content": "<p ><span ><strong>&lsquo;Going Long'</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>by Geoff Pike, 13 Sept 2017</em></strong><br />It's 4:30 am on a wet and windy Saturday in September and I find myself pulling on a GB tri-suit. If you had told me when I was 20, 30 or even 40, that one day I would be able to go for a run for a sol, I'd have been very surprised.  Years of suffering with asthma had left me with a view of myself as someone unable to take part in athletic endeavours. Yet here I was, aged 54 and about to swim, cycle, and run 140.6 miles on a single day. And doing this as part of the GBR team in the European Championships. Something I would not have dreamt of dreaming of until recently! <br />This was my second long-distance triathlon. The first was an Ironman in Maastricht last July, and from my time in that one (11.45), and much to my surprise, I discovered I had qualified for the GB Age Group Team (50-54) at the European Championships at Almere-Amsterdam, Holland. <br />I would highly recommend Challenge Almere to any long distance triathletes - a well-organised and nicely structured event. But being part of &lsquo;Team GB' made the experience even more special. Other team members were very supportive both on and off the course. And I d. <br />I found the 3.8k swim very hard, partly I think as it was my first large, mass start swim. It was mayhem for the first kilometre, especially at the turns. In the frenzy my Garmin got kicked and stopped and I somehow ended up with bruising across the top of my right foot. My swim time (1.09, but not on Strava obvs!) was slightly disappointing being more or less the same as the previous year, despite a lot of swim training.<br />I am not good at transitions but these went reasonably well for me - 6mins each despite a long jog with your bike.  <br />On paper the flat 180k, 2 loop, bike course might look bit of a breeze but it is hard work, especially with any kind of wind, as the course is so exposed. The 10-15mph wind on the day sucked a lot out of me in the last 40k. However, it is spectacular cycling with 30k plus straight along a dyke and through wind farms, and on this day with a nice tail wind. But the trouble with a tail wind is you know it's got a head somewhere, which will come back to bite you sooner or later!  <br />My regular time-trials on the Basin Road (between Hove Lagoon and Carotts Caf&eacute;), and long r, as both are flat and often windy, so help you adapt to long spells r. I was very happy to get off the bike in 5hr 32min - a 50min improvement on the previous year with bike improvement my main focus for the event.<br />And finally, on to the marathon (6x7km loops). Ouch! I've never felt closer to stopping in any race than after about 18k of this one. My stomach was knotted, I felt sick, found it difficult to eat or drink, the sun was now out (damn it), weather had finally got warmer, and my legs were staging a mutiny! I probably slightly over d, and then I made the schoolboy error of running too fast at the start. I was oblivious to my pace as I chatted to a fellow GB athlete for the first loop only to discover he was aiming at a time half an hour quicker than mine...doh! I held on (by the skin of my teeth!) for 3 loops, but gradually slowing up. I watched and sympathised as the local heroine, Yvonne Van Vlerken, ran past and threw up in front of me, and then went on to win the women's race - fair play to her! Joe Skipper, a GB athlete, won the men's, in the eye watering time of 7hr 59 mins! <br />With the finish in sight I managed to summon some strength from somewhere and d, by a massive 11 seconds! I was slightly short on run training due to an Achilles injury in the previous six weeks, and this took its toll a little but nevertheless I was unbelievably happy with the overall outcome. And hugely relieved to cross the finishing line, 10 hours and 54 minutes after I started. With family and friends there to support, and cheer me over the line, it really was one of the proudest moments of my life! <br />Jon Pike, Phoenix Triathlon coach, deserves credit for his support and advice in preparing me for both this event and the Ironman last summer. His knowhow and experience enabled me to perform to a level beyond what I believed possible. But I should also mention the enormous impact Kurt Charnock and Brighton Triathlon Race Series (BTRS) had in prov, without which I may well have never started in the sport. <br />But it is not just expert advice and long hours of training (average about 8-10 hours/week for about 18 months) that's got me here. It's daring to shrug off the heavy habit of believing that athletics and aerobic exercise were things other people d. Starting to have a go, and then keeping going, building up, a bit more each time until finally you find yourself, and to my enormous surprise, to actually be an athlete! <br />The potential of clubs like Phoenix to change lives, create athletes and enable dreams is enormous...</p>\r\n<p><strong>My &lsquo;athletic' career..</strong>.<br />1963-August 2009 nothing much at all bar cricket and golf!<br />Phone call from Eogan McKenna suggesting I try and train for the inaugural Brighton Marathon...what?! <br />From September 2009 I started jogging/running regularly.  <br />November 2009 first athletic &lsquo;race' Arena 10k 54 minutes. <br />April 2010 - Brighton Marathon 3:51<br />June 2010 - First parkrun (22:40 have done 150ish since, PB 19:54)<br />Various 10ks and half marathons from this point.  <br />Summer 2011 - first triathlon with BTRS (on my delivery boy bike, as it was affectionately called) <br />Summer 2012 - BTRS standard distance triathlon and numerous sprints.<br />Joined Phoenix, primarily for the swim training suggested by Nigel Herron.<br />Got a road bike, cycled more. <br />Summer 2013 - First m(5:45)<br />Summer 2014 - Worthing Standard distance (2:40) and BTRS m(6:10) (first experience of bonking!)<br />Started cycling a lot more with Hovelo and occasional commute to and from Chichester.   <br />April 2015 - Second marathon (Brighton) 3:41.

The girls' team, in particular, dominated the East division winning their 4x100m relay in each match. Of particular note were Jess Powell, Isabella Martin and Lauren McLellan. Lauren was unbeaten in her sprints whilst Jess and Isabella were chosen to represent Sussex at the Inter Counties Invitational. Jess finished 4th in the Combined events - two places higher than last year.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The boys' team, whilst not always as dedicated as the girls, also showed some stand-out performances, particularly in the 600m where Joshua Munro and Ben Connolly dominated. Ben was chosen to represent Sussex and Josh's time of 1.41.4 in the 600m saw him ranked 7th in the country for his age. </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Despite all this talent, the County Championships delivered slightly less in the medals department. At the U13 County Champs Keira Patterson-Jewell picked up a bronze medal in the 150m and at the U15 County Champs, Renee Bassin won a bronze medal in the Triple Jump. </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>In the U11 categories we have some talented athletes who will be competing in the U13 category next year. Of note are Angelina Bowen, Imogen Read and Kira Betts in the girls category and Matthew Noakes in the boys. We look forward to watching them all perform over the Winter season in Cross<br />Country as well as Indoors and we wish them health and success for an even better 2018 season.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Thank you Emily for this report &amp; pictures</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><strong><span ><br /></span></strong></strong></p>",

It was raining again!<br />On Sunday morning we put our running gear in the numbered bike slot in T2 and then caught a boat shuttle across the river to finish setting up in T1. The sun came out and the wind dropped raising the temperature up to 17 degrees - a perfect day for racing.</p>\r\n<p>My start time was 11:05. This had already been put back from 10:10 due to the local organising committee realising that the course would have been too crowded on the original start times and so made longer gaps between the waves. On the morning there was an extra 15 minute delay due to problems on the bike course.<br />About an hour before starting I dec. After some str.<br />Time to get ready! I put on my wetsuit and put my post race clothing into an orange bag with my number on and left it at the bag drop to be taken over the river to the finish area. 30 minutes before the start we went into the start pen ready to go on to the pontoon. About five minutes before the start we filed down, getting into the water one minute before the start we are told have one hand on the pontoon. The starter sa. About a minute later I realised my goggles had started to fall off. I managed to get them back on quickly enough and then started to get into the swimming rhythm. I found out later the official swim was 1700m. My time was 24 minutes and 23 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>To get out the water we went up some steps onto a ramp and on to the 800m of blue carpet which took us to T1.Transition went smoothly taking 5 minutes 18 seconds. The wetsuit and goggles had to be put into a blue bag with your number on which was then taken to the finish area. Out on to the bike, which I quite enjoyed, there was certainly things to think about; there were a couple of inc! I tried to concentrate on the pacing for the bike as on the previous two races I had faded on the run - I think that went fairly well. Bike split was 1 hour 7 minutes 57 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>At T2 I somehow managed to miss my rack and had to double back and then when I got to my number slot there was someone else's bike laying on top of my shoes. It was all a bit of a mess and I probably lost a few seconds but what can you do? I was not contending for medals today, not to worry. I got onto the run feeling ok. The run course was 2 laps of a looping route on the footpaths of a municipal park. I d, however, the run was short and my time was 42 minutes 3 seconds.</p>\r\n<p>I finished 38th in my age group out of 111 in a time of 2 hours 22 minutes 13 seconds.<br />Results;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2017_itu_world_triathlon_grand_final_rotterdam/318956\">http://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2017_itu_world_triathlon_grand_final_rotterdam/318956</a></p>\r\n<p>At the finish there was cake, bananas, energy drinks, water and a finishers medal.<br />To my relief the orange bag was there with my clothes in and in a different tent was my blue bag with wet suit in. Not everyone was so lucky.<br />Overall I was happy with the results and enjoyed the event. The following day, however, my right ankle virtually seized up and walking was quite difficult. I'm glad to say this is now almost back to normal after a few days. The doctor says it could be a repetitive strain injury and I should see a physio for treatment.</p>\r\n<p><em>Thank you Malcolm Hughes for this report</em></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Our Vet women are fourth in the official stats and I think third in terms of average points per race spot so more medals possible there too! Main rivals I think are Hailsham, Wadhurst and Eastbourne.</p>\r\n<p >In the worst case scenario we might need anyone injured to walk round at Crowborough, though if we get a good turnout at Hove Prom we could be pretty much home and dry before Crowborough.</p>\r\n<p ><br />The men's teams are on top spot in the official stats - hot favourites for first place, with Wadhurst , Seaford , Haywards Heath and Hailsham in pursuit.<br />Our Vet men also lead the official stats though are not such strong favourites, with the same four teams in pursuit.</p>\r\n<p >We are also strong favourites to take the overall combined Mens/Womens title.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p ></p>\r\n<p ></p>",

I've been wanting to attempt to do one for many years now, seeing various friends and fellow club members notching them up, and 12 months ago I felt now was the right time for me. I signed myself up for Ironman UK 2017, up in Bolton (I like hills!) took on Phoenix's Jon Pike as my coach and ploughed into the crazy but beautiful world of triathlon.</p>\r\n<p>I've always been a runner. After my 8th marathon I was craving a new challenge and the 2.4mile swim, 112 mile bike r.2 mile run seemed like the perfect answer. I gave myself just over a year to train for it and during that time thanks to Coach Pike, learnt about this new world of Mitre time trials, V02 max bricks, Albourne laps, Mill Lane hill reps, Neurukar progressive 10ks, Red Mist swims and some how fitting all this into a normal working life. The training was intense but amazingly fulfilling and gave me an understanding of the phrase 'train,eat,sleep,repeat...'</p>\r\n<p>You get into a bubble when you train for an ironman and almost before I knew it I was up in Bolton ready to start my race. The event itself was highly organised and everything you would expect from a major sports brand. My swim was steady and went to plan, luckily no panic attacks! I had a long T1 sorting out my nerves (silly boy!) and then off on the bike for some South Pennine hills! The weather was wet but a few hours into the r. The bike leg felt great and I kept to the outputs that Jon had previously given me, overtaking lots of people and enjoying the crowd support along the route and up the infamous Sheep House Lane climb. The r(d) and then back into town for T2 and on to the marathon. The first 20km felt good, you run from Bolton football stadium and then begin running laps in and out of town up a big hill, a bit like reps up and down Dyke Road for 26 miles. The last 10km was pretty grim but I was expecting that. Suddenly you're in that finishers shoot, and all the training, early mornings and missed sessions down the pub, they all become completely worth it.</p>\r\n<p>The whole experience is a journey. If you have an inkling of wanting to do one, just go for it. One of the most amazing things. And yes, I would love to do another one.</p>\r\n<p>It's very difficult to do these kind of things on your own, and many people helped me. <br />Thanks so much to Jon Pike for all his advice and coaching, I couldn't have done it without him, Anita Jones, my cycling buddy and mental support, Vicki Linton-Crook for sorting out my appalling swimming technique, Andy Bone for being Andy Bone and Rachael Woolston for telling me I could do it, and not dumping me! Big ups!&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://m.eu.ironman.com/triathlon/events/emea/ironman/uk/results.aspx\">http://m.eu.ironman.com/triathlon/events/emea/ironman/uk/results.aspx</a></p>\r\n<p></p>",

The annual \"Causeway Coast\" race is a multi-distance event with 10k, half marathon, full marathon and even ultra marathon options! I went with a party of running friends, two doing the marathon, one bravely attempting the ultra but most of us, including me, happy to plump for the half marathon ...</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>And what a half it was! After a relatively late rendezvous accounting for local t, we were transported by bus from race HQ at Portballintrae to Larrybane Bay ... quite a foreboding start point, being in a disused quarry built into the cliffs with none of the usual pre-race facilities! <br />Little clues had been given as to the nature of the course other than that it was coastal (indeed the main instruction seemed to be strictly no calls of nature in the quarry as this is National Trust owned land!). And I was soon to discover that coastal was meant in a literal sense as, after small sections of path and road running, we suddenly found ourselves clambering over seaweed covered rocks to get round the headlands before stretches of beach running.</p>\r\n<p>Naturally this put pay to any notion of consistent pacing as the primary requirement was concentration to avo! Thankfully, the terrain d, as we were up on the cliff line, there were numerous ups and downs, as well as stiles and steps to negotiate plus the wind became a factor as the elevation increased. We eventually passed close to the Giants Causeway itself (catching up some of the returning <br />marathon and ultra marathon runners) before rounding the final headland and, for once, behind the final bay (through a golf course) rather than across it, before arriving at the finish ... muddy, wet but exhilarated! I was greeted by one of my colleagues who had completed the marathon and we then waited for the rest of our party to come in (sustained by the free post-race burger!) - thankfully all d!</p>\r\n<p><br />My time was 1:58 (49th position out of 447 runners); certainly one of my slowest half marathon times but I was happy nonetheless bearing in mind the nature of the course!</p>\r\n<p>The scenery d! I would have to say it was one of the most dangerous races I have done and wonder if a few health &amp; safety questions wculd be raised here (I have yet to do the Seven Sisters Marathon - a daunting task but at least you don't run at the bottom of the cliffs!) but it was a great experience nonetheless.

In 2016 just two Phoenix women completed five or more Grand Prix races and the team finished 12th in the Womens' Team competition. This year 12 of our women clocked up over 5 races and until injuries struck we were in the running to take the Womens' Open title - which has to be next years's target!</p>\r\n<p>Post-race celebrations took place at the Wick Inn, where the winners of our vote for Phoenix Grand Prix Athlete of the Year - Izzy Anderson and Andrew Haig - were awarded their trophies. Izzy organised the revival of our Women's Team this year, as well as completing the necessary quota of 8 races despite her pregnancy coinc! Andrew is our all-time Grand Prix champion, regularly completing more races than anyone else and winning his age category unfailingly for more years than any of us can remember.</p>\r\n<p>Team spirit has been fantastic this year with 25 or more Phoenix runners regularly on the start line - and massive contributions to the team from many of our less speedy athletes who finished outs. Provisional dates for next year's fixtures are already listed on our website to go into your diaries, and a revised format will mean that even those unable to pull in the new minimum of 6 races (which is needed to compete effectively for indiv) will still be able to significantly boost our chances in the team competitions.</p>",

He commented:<br />\"No . I think I will have to give the credit to my Nutritionist and fellow SGP teammate Izzy Anderson and her partner Paul Weir for some unexpected help. Normally the day before a race my nerves kick in and I wake up the next morning with my ins, but this time Paul sent me a lovely picture of Izzy and their new baby which worked wonders; I went to bed with a smile on my face and woke on the day of the race full of internal calm!\"</p>\r\n<p>Our only other representative at the Masters Championships was Head Coach Malcolm Kemp, who came home fifth in a very competitive V70 race over a course that was too short and flat for his liking.</p>\r\n<p>Disappointingly our low turnout put us out of contention for any of the team medals, though with our current crop of quality V40 and V50 runners it would be very worthwhile to have a crack at these next year.</p>",

William Carey (10th) Tom Ansell (34), and Eddie Harrison (40) ensured an 8th places team position.</p>\r\n<p>Congratulations to Almi Nerurkar for finishing 1st in 20:27 some 30 seconds ahead of the field. She is now the U13, U15 &amp; reigning U17 champion! Naomi Fonteyn also ran well to finish a respectable 6th but despite their efforts this was not enough competitors to for a team placing.<br />The boys team, however, finished in 3rd position. Well done to Leo Brewer (5th) Ben Martin (10th) Joel Luscombe (18), Daniel Simpkin (20).</p>\r\n<p>The Junior men's race saw some confusion with he first 3 runners being mistakenly sent on an extra lap. Extra well done then to Daniel St! He was closely followed by Oliver Johnson &amp; Reuben Hoyte (4th, 5th) to bring in the winning team.</p>\r\n<p>The Senior men saw the best Phoenix turn out, taking first team place (27 pints ahead of 2nd place Crawley) with the B team in 7th. Of note was Ross Skelton &amp; Sam Wade for finishing 3rd and 4th and Max Pickard 7th.</p>\r\n<p>The Junior women was represented by only Anna Berry who finished 51st overall, 7th in her age group, whilst the Senior women saw just Bobby Searle (23), Lizzy Miles (36) and Sarah Russell (74) run to finish 9th team</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sussexathletics.net\">http://www.sussexathletics.net</a></p>",

          "content": "<p ><span ><strong>Why do Cross country?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>To sum it up cross-country racing is short, fast-paced running across mud, grass and woodland paths. The distances are typically 2k for U11, 3k for U13, 4-4.5k for U15. For the U17, U20 and seniors the races are typically 5k for ladies and 8k for men. There are many reasons why people take part in cross-country so I thought I would share some of them with members who haven't yet experienced a cross-country race, because in my opinion they are missing out!</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>Get fit quick </strong>- Nothing gets you fitter quicker, a XC race is a short, sharp, fitness kick-start.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>Strength and Balance</strong> - It is a great way to build strength, particularly in the ankles, &lsquo;glutes', lower-back and stomach, all of which you will use to run through bogs and up the short, sharp hills, which are a common feature of a cross country course. It also improves your sense of balance, something we take for granted but is essential for healthy living and also for performing in sport. All great runners have great balance, look at how Mo runs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>They are cheap</strong> - The races are always cheap to enter (around &pound;5) with entry on the day for the main Sussex league so really accessible compared to other running races. One of the benefits of being a Phoenix member is that the club often pays for your entry into the bigger events such as the Sussex champs, Southern champs and Nationals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Team spirit </strong>- You will score points in each race/ race league, which contributes to an overall team score for your club. You don't have to be a fast runner to be an integral part of the team as a minimum number of athletes are also needed for a team - this is not always met across the age categories.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Competing for Phoenix</strong> - It's a nice way to represent your club and give back to the coaches who have trained you over the year, competing against clubs in the county, south of England and the whole country.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self-achievement </strong>- The race courses are consistent over the years being held at various locations including Bexhill, Lancing, Hickstead showground and Stanmer. This allows you to compare times very easily and give yourself a goal to achieve over winter. There are also indiv/ race league.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fun</strong> - A really good reason to take part is that it is fun. After struggling through the mud and hills, you can share your trials and tribulations with your fellow club members.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Racing rather than times</strong> - because each course is different, and the distances are approximate, cross country is not really about getting personal bests; however it is about racing against your nearest competitors who you will start to recognize after a few races.  Knowing that you want to catch one more person or hold off a challenge from another racer brings a whole new dimension to the sport.</p>\r\n<p>The cross-country season is throughout the winter and there is a main Sussex league as well as indiv, which can get confusing. The key races/leagues of the season are:<br />Sussex League - Series of four races between October-February <br />Sussex county champs - The race where all the Sussex clubs compete against each other. <br />Sussex masters county champs - This race is exclusive to masters only (ages 35 yrs+ for women and 40 yrs + for men). <br />Southern champs - All clubs in the South of England compete against each other in a race.<br />Nationals - The race against clubs across the whole country!</p>\r\n<p><em>Thank you Bobby </em><span >for this report</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/fixtures\">http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/fixtures</a></p>",

There will no longer be any family or other discounts, though The Board will still have the discretion to grant free or discounted membership in cases of financial hardship or on other grounds.</p>\r\n<p>For all but under-11s, this represents an increase of just &pound;6 a year on present subs. These proposed increases have been kept to the absolute minimum, taking into account the club's current relatively healthy financial state as well as our plans for future fundraising.</p>\r\n<p>Please come to our AGM - 7.30pm , Locker Room , The Sportsman, Withdean Stadium to have your say and vote on this and other important proposals.</p>",

The South of England (SofE) indoor champs on Sunday at Lee Valley incorporated VAC champs.<br />Steve was 1st SofE and VAC in V50 1500m. <br />I was 3rd VAC V50 in 200m, 3rd VAC V50 in 1500m and 3rd SofE &amp;1st VAC V50 in 800m.<br />Pat Davoran also won SofE gold in V45 1500m.<br />We are both entered in the BMAF national champs in 2 weeks time at Lee Valley again.<br />Steve at 800m &amp; 1500m and me at 800m and 3000m.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Steve gives this advice:</strong></p>\r\n<p>I would encourage more masters athletes to compete indoors next year. It is very accessible and this time of year it is great to be able to race in the warm and dry. <br />Phoenix is blessed with great coaches and athletes of all ages - including masters - can seek their advice. Firstly, get yourselves down to the senior Wednesday track sessions with Andy Bone and Sue Hudson - they are great and you'll quickly progress. Long distance isn't my forte, but I now hang onto the back of Malcolm Kemp's group on Wednesday nights, building an endurance base for my m. Knowing my goals, Malcolm set a series of specific m. Not a massive commitment - they take under an hour including warm up and cool down. I've been doing these alone this year so I'd love to have others to train with next season. <br />With a focused training, there's nothing stopping others from winning medals and becoming South of England Masters Champions too!</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"http://bmaf.org.uk/south-of-englandevacvac-masters-indoor-championships/\">http://bmaf.org.uk/south-of-englandevacvac-masters-indoor-championships/</a></span></p>\r\n<div><span><br /></span></div>\r\n<p></p>",

It is designed to add a little excitement to the multisports part of the club - who can perform well over the whole year and over a range of events? It can also help you to select races from the growing number on offer, and lend shape to your season.<br /><br /><strong>How does it work?</strong><br />You enter some, many or all of the events which have been selected to count towards the championship. In each event you are effectively competing against the other Phoenix athletes there, but you are also competing across the total events available. For each event you will get points based on your performance against your club-mates. These are recorded and your best 3 scores counted towards the final reckoning. If you only race one event you will score but the more you do, the better your chances. You do not need to sign up, but if you want to be sure your entries are not missed, then let us know!<br /><br /><strong>How are the events selected?</strong><br />The selection of events aims to include a range of multisports events. There will always be an aquathlon, a duathlon and different lengths of triathlon. There is also a commitment to support local events where possible and to select events which are not too expensive. Some events have been regulars over the years, such as the Frosty (which has run on the same weekend for 23 years and never been cancelled!) while others have come and gone. From experience, we know some popular events can be subject to cancellation or changes and so we avo.<br /><br /><strong>How do I know my points have been counted?</strong><br />To ensure your points are counted you MUST make sure you enter as &lsquo;Brighton Phoenix'. If you made a mistake or forgot, then you must e-mail Hildi as soon as possible after the race (<a href=\"mailto:drhildi@hotmail.com\">drhildi@hotmail.com</a>). Points are based on published results.<br /><br /><strong>When will the results be known?</strong><br />The winners (male and female categories) will be announced at the Phoenix awards night at the end of the year</p>\r\n<p ><a href=\"http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/fixtures\">http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/fixtures</a></p>\r\n<p ><em>Thanks Hildi for this info!</em></p>",

          "content": "<p ><strong><span >What it's like to run for a year</span></strong></p>\r\n<p >I like a challenge.  For a while it was to complete an ironman (and then another, and then another...).  Some I've been successful at (complete the Dart 10km swim; swim round Brownsea Island without a wetsuit) and others less so (get that darn marathon time under 4 hours 30!).  The ones I'm most suited to seem to be the ones where you just keep going (365 miles of swimming in a year, anyone?) so it wasn't a surprise that I acc&lsquo;Runuary' in January 2017, and certainly not surprising when I found that morphing into the goal of running at least a KM every day for a year.<br /> <br />I was actually on hol. On New Year's Day my friend told me about Runuary (where women sign up to support each other running every day in January) and sa. I sa't because I was ill but she persuaded me that I was on the mend and it would be a good way to get back to running.  She pointed out it was sunny, I had a running track on my door-step and that it would pull the hol, sports-wise. I couldn't really argue, although I was still a bit ill and it took a couple of weeks for me to do much in the way of distance.<br /> <br />At the end of January I realized I was lacking a goal for the year.  My husband had signed up for Ironman Sweden and I was looking forward to being the main supporter for this but I was missing a little something myself.  I had Brighton Marathon coming up, but once that was over I was worried I would start to feel resentful that I wasn't also entered for Sweden - although I knew that wasn't feasible in terms of our family life.  That's when the .  The dec. That was a challenge I couldn't resist! <br /> <br />There were only about ten days in the year when it was really hard, and there were probably about half a dozen when I shouldn't really have run (most of them in the last three weeks of 2017 when I was battling a virus). I took my daily run right down to a really really slow jog as a result. In fact most observers probably thought I was walking!  It was physically so hard. The other challenging times were when I had to squeeze a run around a really busy day: for example, running after a day driving from Germany to Sweden for the Ironman; running after a gruelling two-day job interview on the morning of my sister's wedding, and running at 5am on the track at Club La Santa (on a better visit in October!) before packing mine and my k' suitcases and racing to the airport to fly home. But all of these gave me a great sense of achievement and a huge energy boost when I needed it.<br /> <br />Running following my two marathons (after a disastrous performance at Brighton I obviously entered another one) was actually easier than I'd expected, but running after travelling to London for a 5km swim event was pretty tiring, especially as I had to squeeze it in before going to the Phoenix awards night!<br /> <br />On one day in January I remember going out in my pyjamas, coat and wellies to walk the dog because I wasn't feeling the running vibe, and then thought, &lsquo;What the hell!' and ran a kilometre like that. I had to hold my hands over my boobs as I wasn't wearing a running bra! It was then I realised I'd probably been making too much fuss about the effort required in &lsquo;going for a run' in the past. <br /> <br />The biggest surprise was that I d't get injured. I think I learned to listen to my body in new ways. I adjusted my route, the distance and the time of day to reduce grumbles from my calves and my hips (both of which have been problematic in the past).  I was also surprised to get a 5km PB this year. I was marathon training but I think the discipline of the daily run helped me keep my speed up.<br /> <br />My husband thought I would get injured and when I was ill at the end of the year he was convinced I'd make myself seriously ill. To counter that, I d, like swimming, or cycling my new bike!<br /> <br />The best thing about it has been all the amazing sunrises and sunsets I've seen. The experience of the changing seasons, the light, the weather, the world around me, has been a special gift which I'll never forget.  This challenge has made me a better runner than I've been for years, and it's changed my relationship with running. I'll never think I'm too busy to go for a run again!<br /> <br />Update: <br />At the time of writing I've just completed my 425thconsecutive day's running.  In the snow.  I'm not really sure now what it will take to stop me...</p>\r\n<p ><em>Thank you Hildi Mitchell for this report</em></p>\r\n<p ></p>",

The course was traffic free through closed roads and a short stretch of park in the city centre, and not as flat as we had anticipated! Great atmosphere amongst  the  England athletes, and great encouragement  (and photos!) from Bob Page and one or two other Arena 80 supporters. Delighted of course to win my V65 age category with a couple of minutes to spare, though firmly put in the shade by Tonbr's V50 Maria Heslop whose 36:28 was the best age-graded performance of the day at around 94%.</p>\r\n<p>Looking forward to the World Masters Champs in Malaga in September now!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.greatrun.org/myresults/name-search/757/kemp\">http://www.greatrun.org/myresults/name-search/757/kemp</a></p>\r\n<p></p>",

This year's new SGP scoring system means that all our runners, wherever they finished, contributed to the team score, not just the high fliers, of whom there were many. Ash Dorrington, James Miles, Tom Hooper, Erica Martin, Bobby Searle, Amelia Culshaw and Caz Garrett all made it into the top 20 male/female finishers and there were age category wins for Phil Hampshire, Andrew Haig and Paul Whelpton (whose V65 time was the fastest in the UK this year). The only disappointment was the lack of a couple more female runners - we had 8 sol(of any standard!) to challenge for the Women's title this year.

Clearly a crazy year and who sa't happening?</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>So why Boston? Well, it's a bucket list marathon; the world's oldest annual marathon, one of the 6 abbot major world marathons and the only one you have to qualify for. They only issue with doing a marathon that only has good marathon runners is that you worry you're going to come last!! Fear is definitely a good training motivator as this year I've really tried to put the work in so I wouldn't completely embarrass myself!  I was still terrified as everybody I spoke to talked about it being their worse marathon -  starting too fast and then blowing up at &lsquo;heart break hill'. I've never been a particularly disciplined runner so was convinced that this was going to happen to me. For those that don't know the profile of Boston it starts out in Hopkinton and then runs through 8 Massachusetts towns into Boston. It starts with a steep descent (hence going too fast) and then at Mile 16 the hills start just when you are getting a little tired culminating with the 0.8 mile Heartbreak Hill at mile 20 (the clue is in the title!)</p>\r\n<p>About 2 weeks before we started getting emails warning it might rain and to dress appropriately, but who's going to wear gloves and a rain jacket in a major?!! I arrive on a beautiful sunny day and the atmosphere is amazing - blue and yellow plant pots outs, good luck messages on the windows, a massive expo with everyone piece of kit imaginable so I'm starting to get excited. However, the next day we woke up to snow and absolutely freezing temperatures. gulp! Every one is standing at the coffee machine in the hotel asking each other what they plan to wear and going out for runs with new race day kit all with slightly panicked looks on their faces. As we all know runners are a superstitious lot so changing outfits at the last hour is nerve racking. Clearly people have been out shopping as you can't find ponchos or gloves for love nor money anyway..Sold out Sold out - I must have gone to over 8 sports shops!</p>\r\n<p>The morning of the race there is torrential rain and it's so cold. People are dressing in all sorts of gear - plastic bags over the trainers and on their heads , the obligatory bin liners, socks on their hands and in my case wearing full rain gear. There is about an hour bus journey to the start at Hopkinton but you drop off bags for the finish before you get on the bus so whatever you take is going to be left there.  By this point I don't care as there is a lot of hanging around when we arrive - I just want to be warm and dry for as long as possible.</p>\r\n<p>We head to the start and everybody is in good spirits laughing at the situation and at other people's wardrobe choices. There were some seriously bad wardrobe choices which is why 2500 people ended up in the medical tents being treated with hypothermia!<br />So my pen starts off.. All the silly targets I'd set myself ahead of the day I knew were no longer achievable which I think helped me relax. I had to grind through it, keep going and if possible pull off a PB and that was what I d. I started slower than I originally planned but I kept if fairly constant and I knew the 2nd half was going to be slower than the first so planned for that. It was definitely a marathon that made me appreciate my experience as I kept saying to myself little stories like &lsquo;this is not as bad as the Steyning Stinger as at least there isn't mud' and &lsquo;this hill doesn't go as long as the one in Hastings' pulling on any bit of experience that could help me. I can't say I noticed all the views and towns along the way as it was too miserable, but I d'm not sure I would have been there had I not been running. What I do remember clearly is turning the final corner, nearly in tears knowing that I was going to finish the historic Boston marathon, I was going to get a PB (as Mike says a long 3.26 from 3.28. and I d. It certainly goes down as one of my proudest marathons to date and one I still have to pinch myself about (not bad for a girl who d/marathon in over 5h in 2012)</p>\r\n<p>So what next? Well this is only the start of my journey to complete the 6 Abbot World Majors on &lsquo;good for age' places. I have Chicago in October and then will be applying for London, Tokyo, New York. I'm still yet to qualify for Berlin where I need 3.20, so still some work to do. Definitely no chance of me hanging up my trainers anytime soon!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.runbritainrankings.com/results/results.aspx?meeting\">https://www.runbritainrankings.com/results/results.aspx?meeting</a></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Read on for his report....</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Looking back at the Southport triathlon, I went to the race hoping for a good result but was not sure how it was going to go.<br />My winter and spring training had a couple of mishaps so I was not physically where I would have liked; In January I tripped on a route during one of the cross-country races injuring my ankle slightly. This meant I had a couple of weeks of no running at a time when I was supposed to be building the distances. Then in late March early April I came down with a bug which meant I had another 2 weeks off training at the beginning of my build phase, when I start speed endurance.</p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of May I d. That was two weeks before Southport....<br />So with my first sea swims of the year and 3 sol/ run brick sessions followed by some recovery, I put in the best preparation I could for the race....and it seemed to pay off [Malcolm finished first in his age category]!<br />My time was similar to Ripon, last year, which was also a flat course.<br />It's always great to get a medal at these championship races. A small reward for the hard work.<br />Next up I am doing the Leeds triathlon which is June the 10th. This is the Great Britain age group championships and also a qualifier for the European Championships next year. I am also going to attempt to qualify for the World Championships 2019 at the Leeds Castle Triathlon. In September I will be in the Gold Coast Australia for the world championships.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.resultsbase.net/event/4486/results?round=10107&amp;search=hughes\">https://www.resultsbase.net/event/4486/results?round=10107&amp;search=hughes</a></p>\r\n<p><em>Thank you Malcolm for this report &amp; picture</em></p>",

This unique race sees teams of 6 and a driver complete the 100miles of the South Downs Way. Starting at Beachy Head, the runners complete legs (3 each) passing a baton, finishing at Winchester. Phoenix had 3 teams running - Well done to the A Teamfor finishing second and the B Team and Women's teams for finishing 3rd.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Women's Team report</strong><br />This was my first time in twelve years doing the relay without liz H and it felt like an arm or a parent was missing. Erica and Deb were really good replacement navigators though and we d't miss any changeovers or take any wrong turnings with the driving - even with the worst fog I've ever seen on the relay. The women ran well - after a neutralised section to start so that no one fell off the cliff in the fog - so we were towards the front of our start group and consequently had very little minibus traffic compared to previous years. It was a lovely day out as usual and the new additions to the team were brilliant in their attitudes and it was lovely to be reunited with some runners from previous years. Because there was no bar at the finish we were carrying booze on board and Amelia made the most of it - tucking into a can of Stella immediately after completing leg 13. I'm sure she will be welcomed back with that approach to recovery (and with beating her predicted time on every leg!) and she is already planning how to take my women's beer mile trophy off me!</p>\r\n<p>Thank you ladies for letting this past it old bird be involved in the relay by driving again&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em><em>Hildi Mitchell</em></em></p>\r\n<p><em><em></em>Liz Hall</em> also wanted to mention</p>\r\n<p>\"The drivers were Hildi Mitchell, Andy Bone and John Marinko to who we give great thanks. Driving is the hardest job of the whole day, and takes the whole day plus you have to drive everyone home at the end!</p>\r\n<p>Our Club marshals at the Ditchling Beacon handover (the Beacon Beauties), a two baton affair. All the exhausted leg 5 incoming runners were welcomed and the leg 6 runners promptly and accurately despatched by our team of marshals - Sue Hudson, Kathryn Harnett, Jude Matthews, Andrew Haig, Jane Edmonds, Malcolm Kemp (in his first year nor running the relay in 22 years!), Geoff Pike and Liz Hall. Supporters Alex, Jim and Suzanna came and cheered our teams through.\"</p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results\">http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results<br /></a></em></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results\"><em></em></a></em></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results\"> </a></em></p>\r\n<p><em><em><br /></em></em></p>\r\n<p><em> </em></p>\r\n<p ><em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p><em> </em></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

          "content": "<p ><strong><span >All the Way</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>B Team Report</strong><br />\"The thick fog at Beachy head made a fitting metaphor for the story of who was in and who was out of this year's B team. <br />In the final few weeks Liz H had to drop out due to an achilles injury, but found a replacement in the form of Lance B just as he is coming back into form. Dave Powell also had to pull out in the final week due to a leg injury - many thanks to Paul W for stepping up - also on form. Also we made a tactical switch of Donald for Milan in the A team. Paul W highlighted we were lucky to avo(more on that later).</p>\r\n<p>In repeating / sequential leg order were: Phil G, Richard T, Lance B, Pete G, Paul W and Donald M. John M kindly stepped in to drive the bus even though he ended up moving house 2 days before the race...(thanks a million again John).</p>\r\n<p>Due to the exceptional fog, we had a neutralised start from Beachy Head down to Burling Gap then the race started for real.</p>\r\n<p>Based on predicted times, the 0730 start was always going to be a push (to make the cut off at Sustainability Centre) for 1800. Estimated times sa, and with all the changes there was some uncertainty if this could even be achieved.</p>\r\n<p>By the time Lance got to Itford farm, not only d. Pete then smashed leg 4 knocking over 2 minutes off his estimate. It was game on. Paul was tracking his previous year's times on the same legs as we passed through Ditchling - greeted by the Beacon Beauties - or was it the bacon butties I can't remember - in any case the atmosphere picked up - and with provisions re-stocked by local supporters (including beers, pork scratchings and a healthy clutch of Kathryn's husband's (energy) balls) we carried on knocking seconds and minutes off our estimated times.</p>\r\n<p>The hand overs went well - including the new start to leg 8 (note for subsequent years - do not let the runner hang around getting to the change-over here), and as the day went on we settled into a healthy rhythm, picking off more and more runners as we caught up with the earlier starters.</p>\r\n<p>By half way we were pretty certain we had already secured gold for the banter in the b-bus. There was still plenty of chat (and back-chat) around at each changeover too but as we got to 1700 we started to realise that the 1800 cut off was in jeopardy again.<br /><br />Lance had leg 16 to get to there from QE Park but we knew it was going to be tight. With the clock showing 17:59:25 Lance came into sight cresting the hill and was met with 5 runners screaming that he had 35 seconds to get over the line. As photos will testify he found something in his head and legs after Butser hill and made it - with 15 seconds to spare. Awesome.</p>\r\n<p>Leg 17 kicked off with Pete knocking out another storming reduction on his estimate on leg 16 (and holding off the rap's). Handover to Paul was seamless and Paul dug in.</p>\r\n<p>Stopping at both cheering points spirits were up but what happened next goes to show that (a) you can never relax if you are navigating (me), and (b) if you want to stop and cheer at both points on leg 17 - then be VERY sure you know the driving route like the back of your hand. A right turn instead of a straight on at the the pub crossroads set us off towards the A272 but we joined it too far North. Turning right then finding there was no phone signal meant we suddenly were faced with the anxiety of being late for the 17/18 switch and sure enough we were - leaving Paul having nailed it in 64 mins, waiting for us for around 8 minutes.<br />That we came 3rd to Stubbington B who beat us by around 4 minutes left a bitter taste - but the day was still a lot of fun and overall a success. A lot of of laughter, a lot of effort and of course the amazing camaraderie, competition, weather and scenery make this one of, if not the highlight of the running calendar. I'm sure we'll all be back for more.<br />P.s Stubbington B - you got away with it this time. Never again!\" <br /><em>Richard Thompson</em></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results\">http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results</a><br /></em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

The runners, in our case Milan &lsquo;jogged' at 5.45 mile pace to Birling gap where the path veered inland which was the sign that the fuses could be light and the race was off proper. The first few legs were tight between ourselves, Arena 80 and Stubbington Green exchanging the lead between us until eventually we arrived at leg 6.<br />Sean, unfortunately took a wrong turn on this leg and we sl, but as the guys in the team pointed out to me &lsquo;there is a long way to go yet'.<br />We kept plugging away with a strong team spirit and the gap to the other teams reduced as the legs ticked by. Everybody put in a strong effort on their legs, also galvanised by the misconception that only the first two teams would receive a medal!<br />Onto leg 13 in which Josh proved that he too is human. The brutality of the hills on this leg were too much for Josh, after hammering two legs already, he was unable to keep up with the competition and we ended up back in third place, once again with some minutes to make up. By this stage it was clear Stubbington Green were going to win but the race was still on between us and Arena 80.<br />Step up Dave, who had discovered a caffeine sports drink in the back of the van, to unleash a tenacious attack with which he clawed back some minutes. This was followed by Milan who put in a mighty shift up Butser Hill to set me up for a race in my leg. With about ninety seconds to make up, once I had caught the Arena 80 runner I only had one objective; to eek out a few seconds advantage so Alex had a chance on leg 17. The marathon monster was feeling it by this stage, having raced his two earlier legs, but I felt he would power over the hills if he knew all was to play for still and he certainly d.<br />And, back we are in the field with Sean who raced his guts out on the last leg to complete a mighty team effort.<br />I can't say that I have ever been involved in a longer or more thrilling race!<br />A massive thank you also needs to go to our driver Andy Bone who not only ferried us expertly from stop to stop but also brought a calm head and excellent race advice to the team. And thank you Josh, who as team captain organised everything!<br />Well done guys!!!</p>\r\n<p><em>Tobias Bremer</em></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results\">http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results</a><br /></em></p>",

Many thanks to our time keeper Sue Hudson without whom this event could not take place, and to our trig point marshal Malcolm Kemp and supporters Paul Whelpton and Kathryn Harnett (Kathryn missed running in the event due to the joys of commuting by train to London but had a run anyway).</p>\r\n<p>Despite having run 100 miles on the SDW on Saturday Andy Pumphrey returned for more and won the handicap. In entering he had sent the handicapper a photo of his post 100 mile snooze in sleeping bag in Eastbourne and begged a 55-57 minute 10K estimate. The handicapper was having none of it and gave him 50 minutes but of course that was too generous and our AP romped home a good 2 minutes ahead of the predicted time.</p>\r\n<p>Alex Cruttenden was the fastest male running the course in 30:46 having set off well after the field and chasing all but 11 of them down.</p>\r\n<p>Cat Bounds was fastest female in 35:16 having started in a popular pack that included 'pacer' Josh and succeeding in holding her ground to finish 8 in the handicap.</p>\r\n<p>The handicapper had a hold on most of the field with many finishing quite close to the prediction with Lance Bellers finishing in exactly the predicted time. Apologies to Hildi on who the handicapper was too harsh, nonetheless in true Hildi .</p>\r\n<p>Well done to all and thank you for taking part.

Around that time I'd almost completed a training block for a 10 mile running race in October. I was feeling super fit and reckon I was on for a PB and would then be heading into another good training phase for VLM spring just gone. Unfortunately, whilst r, a car pulled out from a s. I ended up in hospital with a few nasty injuries. The recovery was slow and it was a few months before I could do anything remotely physical.</p>\r\n<p ><br />Not wanting to get back on a motorcycle again and not having many options to get to work I dec. My old hybr&lsquo;how to' mechanical v. The low impact nature of cycling helped me build up some strength and early spring this year, my run training and fellow PHX member Milan talked me into the run / bike sessions. I was hooked after the first session and went to as many as I could after that.</p>\r\n<p ><br />Somehow I suffered a &lsquo;finger slip' episode that seems to be common at the club and acc. Turned out that Hannah and Andrew, who were also run / bike session regulars had signed up for the same event.</p>\r\n<p ><br />The motorcycle collision was a proper low point for me so the training and group sessions helped clear the clouds and after some time restored my fitness. That combined with some PHX weekend long r.</p>\r\n<p>I'd never swam free(r) I got myself a 121 crash course and practiced at practiced at the Prince Regent in the mornings before work. I've found the swimming really difficult so knew this would be the weak spot.</p>\r\n<p><br />My plan for the triathlon was to get through that swim as efficiently as possible and not use up too much energy. It took me nearly 13 minutes (I'm sure they made me swim too many lengths!) and according the stats I was in 71st position out of 103 when I got out of the pool. In T1 I had Liz in my head talking about socks so I spent a few extra seconds putting them on. A well practiced flying mount saw me leave T1 with gritted teeth having made up 6 places. I gunned it on the bike losing count of how many people I passed (stats confirmed I made up 42 places) and coming into T2 was a blur. Heading back out on my feet for the 5.1k undulating run was something Liz had us practicing over and over so I was ready. My training buddy Milan was out in Stanmer Park offering words of encouragement and I made sure I used up every last bit of gas I had. The run saw another 5 places made up so finished 18th overall. I only found out later that afternoon that I was the first novice. It was a really nice surprise (not sure if there was a prize though).</p>\r\n<p><br />It goes without saying that I have the bug now and I'm working on my wife to let me upgrade my &pound;350 cyclocross to something made of carbon. I think I'm ready to join the club swim sessions now too.</p>\r\n<p>Liz (Hall) probably doesn't know it but her sessions and coaching, as well as my fellow Phoenix club mates have brought me out of a bit of a dark patch after the motorcycle crash so I can't thank them enough. The race result was the cherry on the cake.Phoenix all the way! \"</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>Thank you Mark for this truly inspiring report.</em></p>\r\n<p><em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

It was also good practice with going straight from cycling into running which took a while to get used to.

It was the longest cycle I'd ever done and with the most hills, but it was so well organised and friendly that I actually enjoyed the cycle the most out of the three, which surprised me.

In the lead up to this race I felt anything but a master (what a daft name that is for us older athletes!) after some poor form in training and a couple of seriously disappointing recent runs - wilting in the sun at Bewl and inexplicably running out of steam at the Phoenix 10k.</p>\r\n<p>It was of course yet another hot day, and we were faced with a hilly two-lap course along undulating country lanes, so my plan, given my gloom at lack of form, was just to go out to try and enjoy the race and run at least the first half at a sensible pace, well under pb level. But as usual the adrenalin kicked in and after 4 miles I was still running almost at pb pace and had my closest rival (South London Harrier Ian Kitching, 2<sup>nd</sup> in the World Masters Marathon Champs in 2016) breathing (in very quiet and relaxed fashion unlike me) down my neck. &ldquo;This is too quick!&rdquo; I sa, and after around 6 miles I slowed down to see if this might persuade him to see an opportunity and move out of my slipstream and give me a tow for a bit, but nothing doing.</p>\r\n<p>On the second lap at around the 8-mile mark we reached the hilliest part of the course and seeing as climbing (unlike a fast finish!) is one of my strengths I pushed on quite hard and to my surprise opened a small gap up on Ian. From then on it was just grit teeth, try to hang on to whoever I could see in front of me, and put any thoughts of Ian storming past me in the last half mile out of my head. And as it turned out, although I d, expecting to see Ian on my shoulder at any moment, he must have felt the effects of my early pacesetting much worse than I d, eventually finishing as third V65 7 minutes or so behind me. I had no , and pushed on for dear life over the last couple of miles before performing my usual trick of collapsing a few yards past the finishing line with a kindly St Johns Ambulance man coaxing me to roll out of the way to reduce the risk of being trodden on by other flagging finishers. Had a good bit of banter with Ian and fellow V65 Des Michael afterwards and can now look forward to renewing battle at the World Champs in Malaga in September.</p>\r\n<p>Possibly a bit undignified racing with a little card pinned on your back displaying your age to all and sundry, but I never minded everyone knowing my age when I was a k. Apparently in age-grading terms I am now the equivalent of the 8-year olds we generally advise to stick to parkruns and come back to join Phoenix when they are a little bit older&hellip;&rdquo;</p>",

Each runner having estimated their time for the 5K hilly course, was set off in handicap fashion, slowest first. They had the choice of which direction to run and had to navigate the course themselves. This should not have been too hard as most had run it before but maybe the dry and very brown landscape was confusing because of the seven starters only three succeeded in completing all of the correct route!</p>\r\n<p>Phil, and Amelia managed to follow a farmers track and thereby miss out the bottom southerly end of the W, whilst Donald added to the challenge by descending the very steep path toward Kingston, realising his mistake part way and retracing his route to complete the whole course. John Lamb also lengthened the course by following a woman that was nothing to do with us on his way out! </p>\r\n<p>Well done to Andy Pumphrey, Erica Martin and Paul Whelpton for sticking to the course. Of those three, Andy was first back on handicap and Paul Whelpton was fastest.</p>\r\n<p>We retired to The Juggs to rehydrate.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results\">http://www.brightonphoenix.co.uk/results</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Of course, I had no . As I got older and found out more the dream became more and more of a pipe dream: too difficult, too complicated, too hard. I put the dream away.</p>\r\n<p>Then I discovered triathlon. I realised that you can achieve incredible things and there are people out there who will help you. I retired from triathlon to concentrate on my job and my k, but the seed of adventure had been planted. My open water swimming adventures, which were supposed to be &lsquo;less' (in time, energy and money) than triathlon, became more important to me than ever as my life but more stressful. Little challenges like swimming every month through the year without a wetsuit became more important. The growth of social media and the people I met and stayed in touch with from swim events like 2swim4life (&lsquo;swim an hour on the hour every hour for 24 hours') helped me learn more about the sport. Just like in triathlon when the question starts to be, &lsquo;can I do an Ironman?', in open water swimming the question starts to ask itself, &lsquo;can I swim the channel?'.</p>\r\n<p>I dec/2021. We started finding out about it but we weren't quite sure. Meanwhile I saw a post from someone asking for a reserve for a relay team this year. I had just returned to swimming after a bit of a break and it seemed right. When we met up we realised we were all local, had mutual friends, and it seemed meant to be.</p>\r\n<p>The training started in earnest straight away as I only had 4 months to prepare. I was already fairly acclimatised to the temperatures but was not spending long enough in the water. It was tough to get in and stay in! We had done interesting swims including one where we got lost in the fog in May. I bought a whistle for my tow float after that.</p>\r\n<p>We had to do a two hour qualifying swim. In the end this had to be brought forward as we watched the sea temperature climb in the heatwave. We ended up doing it after work which wasn't , but i had already done it a couple of times in training and it was a conf.</p>\r\n<p>I returned from a 3 week hol(much swearing and cursing in the direction of the coach!) and then had a taper where I just d. I came back into Autumn weather!!!! I spent my first day home getting in the sea to get re acquainted with the temperature. Luckily the sea still felt warm and it was better in than out!</p>\r\n<p>Our window for the swim opened on Sunday 26. The weather was predicted to be stormy and windy. It was a waiting game. The pilot sa. On the plus we would be landing in the daylight. This was not to be. With such uncertainty we booked a hotel in Dover and headed off. Another change - the swim was confirmed for Tuesday morning!</p>\r\n<p>The morning of the swim we went for breakfast next to the marina and then slightly hysterically went to meet the pilot and observer. We had packed a car load of stuff - large bags each of warm clothes, towels, blankets and sleeping bags, as well as 4 bags of food. In the final week the pilot had asked how many supporters we had coming and we had realised that maybe this meant a supporter who wasn't swimming might be a good . Luckily my other half jon knows a bit about both sailing and endurance sports and was willing and able to come along.</p>\r\n<p>We were briefed and then set off the short boat journey to Shakespeare beach where Sarah, our #1 swimmer and the fastest in the team jumped in and swam to shore to start the swim on the claxton. It was exciting and scary all at the same time but we were ready to get going. The first changeover was negotiated: next swimmer jumping in the water on 5 second countdown, the current swimmer quickly to the steps to get into the boat, and once they are clear of the water, the new swimmer starts swimming.</p>\r\n<p>The first leg for all of us was weird getting used to swimming next to the boat, getting used to the level of visibility and trying to establish a good pace which we could keep going. We swam 1 hour each on rotation and expected to swim at least 4 times but were prepared it might be 5. The distance is 21 miles at the shortest point but the t. On a spring t(a big t) the t.</p>\r\n<p>The second swims started to get interesting. I'd seen a few jelly fish in leg 1 but on leg two I got stung. I d't even see it, just had a sudden burning on my shoulder, armpit and around my ear. It took everything to just keep swimming. The team on the boat hadn't even seen. I'd had a great rhythm going until then and that put me off so I was disappointed with the last half of that swim, but when Sarah got in she ended up in a swarm of jellies and was getting stung again and again. We were all (team, jon, observer, pilot) on the back of the boat encouraging her - she amazingly stayed in and kept swimming but her speed had really dropped.</p>\r\n<p>Team captain rob was next in. In my head I was wondering if I could make myself jump back in and swim with the jelly fish. My shoulder was still reminding me what might be in store. I would be after rob. He showed his team captain strength and just jumped in and swam for his life. The pilot had told the two of us that we really needed to push the pace so we could hit the t. After Sarah had been slowed by the jelly fish it was even more important. Rob was a machine!! &lsquo;Just do the same' I was told by the pilot! I jumped in and pushed and pushed. Jon was offering us drinks and feeds at the half hour point but I'd told him I just wanted to swim without a break. At half an hour I was given a shout and I pressed on with my swim. I was kicking and trying to keep my cadence up like I was doing a 400 sprint tri. I had no . After a while I shouted up, &lsquo;how much longer!' And they told me 15 minutes. I kicked on and pushed on. When I finally clambered up the boat I had nothing left, and had generated so much heat that I was warm from head to feet.</p>\r\n<p>The cold was always a worry. Despite the water being a balmy 18/19 it could still be a challenge to be properly warm, preventing injury and keeping able to eat and drink. Si was finding the cold the worst as his more athletic build meant he felt the cold. Jon was invaluable in helping him warm up and feed. He was busy making hot drinks, having dry clothes ready as well as constantly making sure someone was on the back cheering on the swimmer.</p>\r\n<p>The next few hours were a blur. Broken up into hours and then into half hours or twenty minutes as people wanted hot drinks during their swims as night fell. I d't take any drinks preferring to swim hard to keep warm as I d't want to lose any time which might lead to a missed t. The pilot kept his counsel and wasn't prepared to commit to when and where we would land. We looked like we would miss the cap Gris Nez and make the beach north at Wissant, but nothing is certain in Channel swimming. As I prepared for my 4th swim the pilot sa. I wasn't really sure what that meant! Si was tired and cold and I d't want him to swim again if he d't need to, plus the ! Just before I went in we heard that another boat, the Sea Satin, had just completed their crossing and they came up to us as they started their return. We offered our congratulations and they cheered as I entered the water in front of both boats (I later found out they were a 6 person Dutch team). It took a while to find my rhythm on this swim and I felt I was swimming off the front of the boat too much so I kept pulling back. Suddenly the boat stopped!!! Everyone yelled at me to keep swimming but I couldn't understand where I was supposed to swim to. They were telling to to swim towards some lights but I couldn't work out which ones. Eventually Jon told me to swim towards a vertical line which he sa. I had been expecting a beach but the t. Get on with it, they all shouted, or the pilot says we will have to do another changeover - which by this point would have been complicated. I swam on in the darkness towards the line somehow able to not feel scared but just feel the urgency of completing the swim and someone shone a light on the steps. I realised then I was only about 100 metres from shore! As I got closer the steps got clearer and I saw people on top cheering. I heard the rest of the team swimming behind me. I climbed up the steps out of the water and shouted and then wondered if that was enough so climbed to the top where a half dozen French youths high fived and took selfies with me! The rest of the team climbed up the steps and there were hugs and cheers. Then, after my shortest ever trip to France, we were down the steps and swimming back to the boat.</p>\r\n<p>Back on the boat it was a blur. Jon got the champagne glasses out but the next thing I knew were were all asleep. It was 3.30 in the morning. We dozed in various positions the two hour journey back to Dover. We had the champagne in the car park, and our adventure was over - for now! I will be back for more now I know what is possible!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>thank you Hildi.... amazing report!</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Hosted by Bitton Road Runners who have ties to our own Women's captain Bobby Searle, we were offered accommodation and a delicious Italian meal (wine optional) as part of the first phase of what promises to be a burgeoning exchange program.</p>\r\n<p>When it came to race day an extremely variable forecast, which earlier in the week peaked at 43mph winds, actually delivered a cold and wet day that was suitable for some potentially fast times.</p>\r\n<p>Our runners duly obliged with a series of Personal Bests across the board. The highlight was a sensational run from Milan Watson who finished 30th in a time of 75:23. After a series of misfortune and injuries, it's incredibly exciting to see what this breakthrough will lead to with Beach Head marathon around the corner.</p>\r\n<p>Alex Cruttenden wasn't far behind in a very quick 76:49, followed by Tobias Bremer who is in strong shape 3 weeks before the Munich marathon. TB clocked 78:02 and bashed out 6 miles afterwards just for good measure.</p>\r\n<p>Another superb run on the day was produced by Dave Powell who misleadingly sa. Arm warmers could be the way forward....</p>\r\n<p>Tom Hooper lowered his PB to 80:59, and Rachel Gorman's wonderful 87:44 secured her 17th place in the Women's race.</p>\r\n<p>Cyril Crua was another athlete setting a new PB, running 89:22 to dip under 90 mins for the first time after a hum.1 mile distance in Chicago earlier in the summer (and shaving nearly 5 mins off his previous best in the process).</p>\r\n<p>Our res(F45 7th) and continue her incredibly consistent season that shows no sign of slowing down.</p>\r\n<p>The Phoenix contingent was completed by Bobby Searle (98:45), back from injury, and pacing Georgia Flowers (1hr 46 - just 2 mins outs) for 8 miles before stretching her legs for the final 5 miles around the twisting streets of her home City.</p>\r\n<p>In summary it was an excellent weekend, and a huge congratulations to all the runners and again to Bitton for their hospitality and generosity. We look forward to the return leg, with the balance of drinking Vs actual running still being thrashed out by club reps.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em>thanks Tom Hooper for this report</em></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.greatrun.org/myresults/advanced-search\">https://www.greatrun.org/myresults/advanced-search</a><br /></em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

We asked some of the members of our squad to  pick out some of the best moments for us</p>\r\n<p>PHIL GRABSKY: Malaga 2018.  I have to be honest : I don't think I had heard of the term &lsquo;Masters' until recently but one of the joys of running for me has recently been working out what terms like V50, SGP and VO2 meant.  Now I can add &lsquo;Masters'. Basically races for anyone over 35.  This year's world champs in Malaga seemed like a great , especially when 7 of your buddies are going too - so, lo &amp; behold, I find myself one hot and hum, Chile, India, Turkey, Spain, Argentina, Australia and the GB for a 5000m.  I should add that I had only done my first ever 5000m track race a month before and this is very different to a Park Run. Twelve and a half laps - not a bollard, cone or dog-on-a-lead in sight. My fear was it would be a bit dull but it certainly isn't that. I also thought it would automatically be faster than a Park Run (I run around 20-15 to 20-30 with a PB of 19-56) but it isn't that either. It's both an exercise in pacing and a proper race. I was only a novice but already I knew that who you choose to run behind makes a big difference and, as I kept telling myself leading up to the gun, don't go off too fast. Two weeks earlier - in my second 5000m on a track - there had been a pacer for 20'. I chose to try and follow him: the first lap seemed slow &amp; stately and loads of people had bounded off in front of us but by the third k we were passing them. We kept to a steady 4'/km all the way and with a bit of a sprint at the end I hit a 19-56.  So I knew at Malaga not to rush off at the start. And what happened? Bang - and sprint. I find myself in third place after one km running at 3-40'/km - I know it's too quick but I try to hold on rather than slow down (which I soon start doing anyway). This time it was me who became the hare that the tortoises passed. I came in 7th (in my race which was the slowest of the three 5000m V55 finals) in 20-25. A bit disappointing but the point was it really d't matter - I had run in an international championship - been cheered on by those who knew me and plenty who d't. I also got to see others run - both friends and total unknowns (from superb quick 5k runners to &lsquo;hats-off-to-them-for-being-there 90-year-old long jumpers...).  Watching your pals do their races and, in some cases, win medals was thrilling. Malaga itself was great (and with beer at two euros a glass!) and full of 8000 international athletes. It was a bit embarrassing wearing a GB vest that I had earnt only by paying an entry fee but I was proud and excited to do so too. And half the battle and credit of any race is ensuring you're on the start line.  In sum, I can't recommend it enough - whatever your standard - and there will be plenty of us to cheer you on at the Europeans in Venice next year or the World Championships in Toronto the year after.</p>\r\n<p><br />PAUL WHELPTON: Although we experienced mixed  fortunes in our races on the track and road, the experience was a fabulous one for all of us. The atmosphere really does feel quite similar to the Olympics, with thousands of athletes in their national kit  thronging the stands and competing against each other. There are some obvious differences of course: the age range of the athletes starts at 35 and goes all the way to over 100,  and there are no minimum qualifying standards, so many  of the events feature fun-runners mingling - at least at the start of the race - with the world-.</p>\r\n<p>The number one highlight for me  has of course to be returning with a full set of medals - Indiv. They were both really exciting races, ending with a lap of the track at the Main Stadium where my lack of finishing speed  made things difficult, as I clung on to second place in the 10k by just six seconds and got squeezed into third place by just 3 seconds in the Half Marathon. I loved the friendliness from other athletes, and the spectating too, especially seeing Steve Atkinson post 3 pbs in the 800m and 1500m races and fight his way back on the last lap of the 1500m semi to make it into the Final  after three runners had overtaken him.</p>\r\n<p>STEVE SELBY: Away from the track we savour life in bustling Malaga; early morning walks through the now quiet maze of alleyways , only recently vacated  by  boisterous revellers heading homewards after waking us in the small hours (the one drawback of our centrally-located flat! ). We  break into a jog in the morning sun for a half hour run through the lovely botanic gardens with sunlight breaking through the canopy of trees above our heads. We then return to our flat for the team breakfast of coffee / fresh bread / jam / eggs and avocado on toast. Then it's off to Carranque Stadium to see the world's best over 35s perform amazing  feats of age on the track to thunderous applause . Sore throats ease as we head back to the flat to listen tolerantly to Whelpton's daily musings on who his potential rivals may be in the Half. The Kenyan? Who is this Kenyan ? Surely his reported times can't be accurate? We all ponder ... !</p>\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n<p><br />MALCOLM KEMP: One of my most memorable moments was when I registered for my races at the imposing main stadium on the day I arrived. I walked out on to the gallery in the towering main stand and was confronted by this 9-laned blue track, thinking I've got to run twelve and a half laps on that in two days time!</p>\r\n<p>NIGEL HERRON: A fantastic experience. The standard was world-quality but completely inclusive. We were all athletes together,  speaking the language of \"Ouch!That hurts\".?Come and join us on the next adventure, if you are old enough!<br /> --</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://world-masters-athletics.com/championships/results-championships-outdoor/\">https://world-masters-athletics.com/championships/results-championships-outdoor/</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

          "content": "<p ><span ><strong>The Idiots gu(Marathon/Ultra 105)</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><em>Andy Pumphrey gives his account of the Tor Des Geants Ultra.......</em></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was first made aware of the Tor Des Geants around five years ago when my friend Cliff told me that another friend Lorenzo had just completed this race, at the time I d't think much of it. It was not until I was taking part in the Lavaredo Ultra Trail that I was made aware of how tough it was. It was in Cortina, Italy where Kevin Bush and I were wearing our UTMB finisher tops and Lorenzo came out wearing his Tor Des Geants finisher top. Kevin commented that our UTMB tops were not in the same league as his finisher jacket.</p>\r\n<p>Being a little competitive, I had to look into this race and when I looked at the distance and height gain I wondered if it was possible to run/march over 200 miles up and down the s. When I read about the race I discovered that the Tor des G&eacute;ants is one of the premier endurance trail running races in the world. It is a non-stop 340K ultra-trail race covering an entire region; from the 4,000m Italian Alps to the Gran Paradiso Natural Park and the Aosta Valley. The race crosses 34 municipalities, 25 mountain passes, 30 alpine lakes, and 2 national parks. It has a mountain elevation of 24,000m and actual climbing of around 30,000m. On top of this, on average only 50% normally finish the race due to fatigue, illness, weather or injury.</p>\r\n<p>Following my early retirement from my 24/7 job in London I dec't have a go now, I would never enter. So in went my entry showing all the previous mountain races I had completed. I also looked at the list of other British runners who had entered and was now even more concerned that: \"I am out of my league\". But to my excitement I got in, this was quickly followed by that sudden realisation that I now had a massive race ahead of me and it was over twice the length of any other mountain race I had previously completed.</p>\r\n<p>To give myself the best chance possible I d(basically do as much as possible without breaking anything) I d, long distance races each month (Marathons/ultras) I ran the South Downs way 100, Transylvania 100, ran a marathon each weekend and also ran up and down the s. I can honestly say that since my entry was accepted there has not been a single day the TDG has not been on my mind, this race can take over your life and for me it d.</p>\r\n<p>As well as running this race, for me it was a logistical nightmare. The preparation is so important, you have to take so much kit and you need to plan this race to the finest detail. Because of sleep deprivation you even need a list to remind you what to do at the Life A, when the brain is in a mess you will forget something and your race will be over or you will be disqualified. Your kit even includes transporting running crampons and enough batteries to keep your two head torches running for up to 6 days. If you are discovered without the extensive kit in your running back pack you will be disqualified.</p>\r\n<p>So with two suitcases full of kit, I arrived (a bit stressed) at a nice camp site just outs. All was going to plan? As with all older men we have to get up in the night to have a wee. Unfortunately during this process I fell over and all I remember is waking up on the ground. I sa. Being a trained first a, d. However next morning I discovered I had a broken nose, two black eyes, a nasty cut on the s, all this and I had not even started the race.</p>\r\n<p><br />Following some First A. Every shop has TDG posters and there are banners everywhere. I went to the registration and they checked almost every part of my kit and d. Very different to the 5 minute pre-race briefing I normally get.</p>\r\n<p>I also collected my Life Base Bag, this bag is transported along the route and meets you six times, at each life base. In this bag you put extra clothes socks, spare running top; spare microfleece sweater, food, gels, instant energy bars, packs of batteries, battery charge packs, sunscreen, foot care tape, wet wipes, loo roll, medical kit, body gl, a second bigger pair of trainers, spare insoles, toothbrush and most important English tea bags.</p>\r\n<p>Next morning, was the day of the race, so on with the running kit and a 20L running bag that has so much kit in it that you think you are carrying a small child on your back. I am now at the start with 900 other hopeful competitors, to say I'm nervous is an understatement. We now have well over 200 miles to run and about 28 mountains to run up and down. The send-off was amazing with thousands of spectators, lining the streets and cheering us off.</p>\r\n<p>Almost immediately we marched up the first mountain of over 2500m and then immediately down the other s. Then as soon as we came down one mountain we went straight up the next one and this is why it's called TOR DES GEANTS. You don't get nice flat bits to jog along, except for one small section it's almost all straight up and straight down one mountain after another. Many of the mountain paths are extremely technical and dangerous; one slip in the wrong place and you will plunge down a mountain. Sadly people do get injured and last year one poor guy was killed. The only way I could cope with this was to just pretend the drops were not there. The terrain on many of the climbs are extremely brutal and you often question how you will get to the top and then when you finally make it to the top you think how the hell will I get down there. </p>\r\n<p>To put the height and terrain into some prospective, Ben Nevis is 1,345M whereas most of these mountains are over 2,500M. In addition the terrain destroys your kit. During the event I wrecked a brand new pair of trainers, destroyed two pairs of socks, destroyed a Gore-Tex pair of trousers, snapped one running pole and broke the handle on the other running pole.</p>\r\n<p>Smelly - After 3 days in the same clothes I finally had the chance to change into a set of clean clothes. Up to that point I must have stunk. Lucky for me I have no sense of smell. Anyone who knows me will be aware that since a head injury I have no sense of smell. However even I could taste (in the air) how bad I stunk. If you dec.</p>\r\n<p>Sleep - We started this race at Sunday lunchtime and I finished at 12.20 on Saturday morning 132 hour later. During that time I had just 5 hours sleep. I don't know how I kept going with so little sleep but somehow with power naps I d. For example on the last final uphill section before the last 5k run down into Courmayeur I was so desperate for sleep that I kept falling over and d. At the top of the hill was an a, so I collapsed on to a deck chair and asked them to wake me in half an hour, I then passed out? Half an hour later, when they woke me, I was back to normal and ran all the way down an evil technical track to the finish without any problem.</p>\r\n<p>The Weather was good during most days it was 25-30 degrees and at night on the mountains it was below freezing. We had one lightning storm and two nights of rain. At one point we thought we were in a m? This happened whilst going up one mountain on a wet night. We suddenly had some amazing sporadic rain, the rain was so heavy that you could almost drown in, this went on for around two minutes until, we realised we had stup.</p>\r\n<p><br />Diet - When you are running, marching and climbing for 23 hours a day you probably consume between 8,000-10,000 calories, somehow you need to put as much of this back as is possible. The food was good and I managed my diet very well, at each station I always consumed a bowl of pasta with ham cheese, bread and fruit. I also filled up a goody bag with biscuits, sweets and dried fruit of which I grazed on between stations. This worked well for me and kept my energy levels up. During the week I only lost around half a stone in weight.</p>\r\n<p>The Route &amp; Support - The route is spectacular and I was privileged to witness some of the best views I had ever seen. The course was very well marked and I only went slightly off-course 3 times. There were over 2,000 support staff, that is two for each runner and the a, also some of the people were at the a.</p>\r\n<p>Cows - One small risk is the wildlife and on one occasion we d, it is strange that even when you are totally knackered and your life is at risk you have this energy to run like hell.</p>\r\n<p>The race is so strange in that, there is no end to it, you finish one day and it just rolls into the next day and then the next night and so on, it just seems to go on and on. When I got to Courmayeur and the finish was a few hundred yards away I knew then I had done it. I d't care who was in bed at 12.20am I was going to celebrate. I was not shy about my finish and let the whole town know that Andy from the UK had arrived. Luckily for me a few hundred late drinkers were still up and more than happy to cheer me in. At the finish you run up a large platform and celebrate. I celebrated the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.</p>\r\n<p>The race took me 132 hours, I came 260th out of 900, I was extremely pleased with my race and how it all went, and other than my broken nose I only had one small blister.</p>\r\n<p>In Summary this was the best race of my life in so many ways and I would recommend it to anyone who is mad enough to enter</p>\r\n<p>I have now been back one week and I need to rest up for a bit, as I physically knackered.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p></p>",

Much to our delight, Richard Nerurkar who had to start in the group behind us soon managed to catch up and we were a full team.

One of our most remarkable collective achievements was the turnout from our members: a total of 31 Phoenix runners participated, representing almost 10% of the whole field and more than a third of all club runners.<br /><br />The only obstacle between our team and those coveted PBs and prizes was a sea of lactate. Phoenix embraced the pain, led by Ian Leitch who won the men's race in 31:38 with a minute's lead on the second runner.<br /><br />Our women raked the SGP points in with Charlotte bringing 495 points, Amelia 494, Anna 493, Caz 492, Gill 485, Izzy 483, Taff 469 and Sarah 455. The men's strong turnout produced some impressive performances too: not far behind Ian's 500 points was Patrick coming 4th in 33:55 with 498 points, Paul Wishart 479 points followed by Paul Whelpton 475 points and 1st V60 by 1 whole second! Steve Selby brought 465 points, Lance 460, Pete 456 with a strong performance just a few days before the Beachy Head marathon. Will brought 451 points, Malcolm 430, Andrew Haig 420, Daniel Allen 418, Scott 412, Rob 409, and Gary 403 points.<br /><br />Although the weather warmed up during the race the wind remained very mild and the conditions great for breaking some personal bests, and we certainly made the most of it as we skilfully circumnavigated cyclists and high-fived children to bring home the following trove: Paul Weir came 9th with a new PB of 35:18, Steve Atkinson took 15 seconds off his PB (and the V50 prize as a bonus!) in a stunning 36:03. Lewis came 13th with a new PB of 36:07, Sean smashed 37mins by 6 seconds, Matt in 37:08, Cyril joined the sub-40 club with a 2:22 PB thanks to Steve Selby's skilful pacing, Phil dipped under 42min with a new 36s PB of 41:46, Richard lowered his PB by almost 8 minutes in 44:19, and Chris Berry broke 45 in 44:46.<br /><br />Although some are threatening to boycott Hove Prom 10k until the biscuit medals are brought back, Arena 80's organisation, support and encouragements for all runners was outstanding, and whoever was in charge of planning the weather should get a well-deserved pay rise!</p>\r\n<p><em>Thanks to Cyril for sending this report.</em></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nice-work.org.uk/races/hove-prom-10k/2018\">https://www.nice-work.org.uk/races/hove-prom-10k/2018<br /></a></em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Despite a couple of very strong athletes from Highgate Harriers pulling away, Pickard managed to stay well in contention, finishing fast to hand over in sixth position.</p>\r\n<p>Leg two was run by the newest member of the Phoenix AC team Declan Neary - the Yorkshire-born man ran sensationally to gain a further two positions, rounding off his leg in fourth place with a time of 14:25; the 13th fastest time of the day.</p>\r\n<p>He handed over to Oliver Johnson who prov, holding his position well to take Phoenix into the final leg in sixth place - not bad for a young man who has barely started his Winter training following a Summer break.</p>\r\n<p>The final leg of the day came from Archie Davis, who had to put up with being chased down by the two fastest athletes of the day - one of those a current training partner of Double-Double Olympic champion Mo Farah.<br />After running the majority of the final leg by himself, Davis picked up one more place to take the team to fifth, running the ninth fastest leg of the day in an impressive 14:15.</p>\r\n<p>An exceptional performance from the whole team at such an early stage of the season - proving that the depth of Phoenix's running squad is possibly the strongest it has ever been. That says a lot for a club with such a successful history...&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ollie Johnson adds:</p>\r\n<p>&rdquo;The Southern Cross Relays were much more difficult in comparison to the Sussex Cross Country Relays. The course was much flatter but it was also very uneven underfoot so it was difficult to get into a good rhythm. Max Pickard and Declan Neary d. I handed over to Archie in 5th and that's where we finished. There were some top half marathon/10k/5k runners that we were up against so we were very pleased with the result. Training prior to this was more endurance based, with 800m reps on the track and a threshold session on the Monday before the race. It was a hot day so it was a very good test.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>Thank you Archie &amp; Ollie for these reports - as impressive as the running!</em></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.seaa.org.uk/index.php/results/cross-country\">http://www.seaa.org.uk/index.php/results/cross-country</a><br /></em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

It turned out to be much more than that on the day though.</p>\r\n<p>Simply it's a race that delivers way more than its fair share of endorphins per mile than most others. That's not just me but everyone I have spoken to that has completed it.</p>\r\n<p>If you've run or know the SDW relay you'll be familiar with big chunks of legs 1 and 2. Picture staggering views from the r, the support through Jevington, Alfriston and Exceat, taking in the best parts of Friston Forest and then finishing over the 7 sisters, all on a cool clear day in near perfect running conditions. I forgot the excellent marshalling, a.</p>\r\n<p>My favourite shout out was an enthusiastic Phoenix supporter reminding me after 20 miles of hills it was 'only the sisters and then you're home mate'. I've heard similar welcome shouts at 20 miles in the Brighton marathon, but compare Basin Rd South with the view of the 7 sisters stretching ahead of you towards Belle Tout lighthouse, turquoise waters against those intensely white cliffs, a spitfire doing a fly by (no joke) - and and you may be able to understand why this race should be cons. Each time you crest one of the sisters it's like a shot in the arm to get you over the next one. It is simply an all round winner.</p>\r\n<p>I want to thank Pete and Phil for most of the shared long runs and encouragement. In the weeks leading up we discussed multiple theories and tactics for the &gt;3500 ft of elevation gain - but for me it was summed up by Milan who had just nailed a sub 3 and a position on the podium. When I asked him how he tackled the bigger hills his advice was just to run it hard all the way. Maybe it was just that easy... &ldquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>Thanks Richard - great report!</em></p>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"../../results\">http://www.brightonphoenix.org.uk/results</a><br /></em></p>\r\n<p><em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p></p>",

But the Almijara Trail Half Marathon, through rocky ravines and climbing 1000m up tiny mountain footpaths in the Sierra de Almijara, was just too tempting, starting as it d&rsquo;s throw away from the hol in nearby Nerja on Spain&rsquo;s sunny southern coastline.</p>\r\n<p>Not the easiest race either for a tall skinny runner with a high centre of gravity and very poor balance, (as displayed to much amusement during our Wednesday Track session warmup drills). Slightly frustrating to see young nimble locals bounding past me on the long stretches of tricky downhill paths whilst I lumbered down dislodging loose stones and fearing the worst &ndash; though I only took a tumble once and made sure the cracked rib stayed clear of the impact! Uphills were lung-bursting but great fun &ndash; despite lots of scrambly bits that were hard to walk up without using your hands let alone try to run up. And as soon as the paths w&rsquo;d overtaken me on the tricky downhill bits.</p>\r\n<p>Other things I loved were the great welcome from locals (plenty of spectators shouting encouragement even at the water stations right up in the mountains, and half a dozen runners must have stopped to help when I took a tumble); the totally amazing views of valleys mountains and sea; and the exhilaration of charging down the relatively easy finishing stretch - 3 km along familiar w the weirdest negative split I&rsquo;ve ever done: slowest km 11mins 10 seconds, last km 3mins 50 seconds! At 2 hours 25 that has to be my slowest ever Half Marathon, but it got me on the podium as fastest V65 and with a prerace target of sub 2:30 I was pretty satisfied with my time. Will definitely be badgering Andy Pumphrey for some tips and working on my downhill technique so I can have another crack at this one next year!\"</p>",

The (vegan) food was pretty damned good and we kept the bespoke bar pretty busy. What with music, visual displays, dancing and animated conversations (often about running!) the evening could be judged an undeniable success.<br /><br />Oh, and there were awards presented. Chairman Mike Townley managed to keep matters to a pitch perfect 45 minutes and Lance Bellers was duty photographer. A selection of his excellent photographs accompany this report. There are more available on our group Facebook page or you can email us if there is a particular one you would like a copy of. So thanks to Mike and Lance (who organised the sl), to Paul Whelpton for negotiating the organisational minefield and to Zeina Clare for making the social arrangements.

An incredible 83 Phoenix runners took part and made quite an impact.It was beautifully organised and marshalled and attracted a record 700 athletes. Conditions were perfect &ndash; soft but not muddy underfoot, a gentle breeze and a mild temperature.<br /><br />The headlines for Phoenix? Well no doubting the run of the day. <strong>Almi Nerurkar</strong> won the senior women's event after a heart-stopping sprint to the finish giving her a two second lead over Emma Dixon of Brighton Tri. Brilliant Almii! There was a healthy turn out of 16 athletes in the women's race. <br /><br />The senior men won the day with 59 points to Brighton and Hoves's 74. <strong>Ian Leitch</strong> (M40) was our first finisher in in 5th place and we had four in the top 10. An unprecedented 39 men ran which means that the results show Phoenix A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I teams.<br /><br />For the U20/senior women's race the A team finished a mere 8 points behind the leaders, Arena 80 in division 1. So everything to play for. Again the turnout allowed us B, C, D and E teams</p>\r\n<p>The under 17 girls notched up a significant win with a points score of 19 over second placed Crawley (33 points). <strong>Maia Hardman</strong> led the charge with an excellent 3rd place<br /><a href=\"../../results\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"../../results\">Detailed results</a></p>\r\n<p><em>Thanks to Liz Hall</em></p>",

          "content": "<p ><span>Brighton 10k was my last target race the year. I know, there are other races coming up, but they involve either hills or mud, or both. So this is more my thing: flat and fast (speed being relative). My goal was to go under 36mins, and training had been going OK at Wednesday&rsquo;s track sessions, but my regular road runs were mostly &ldquo;trending slower&rdquo; on Strava. I&rsquo;d stepped up my weekly mileage, which could help explain my drop in pace, as could the extra 2kgs of weight I&rsquo;ve put on since the track season (just a bit of padding to help get through winter).</span></p>\r\n<p ><span>Three days before the race, disaster seemingly struck. On an evening run down an unlit country lane I stepped into a shoe-sized pothole and twisted my ankle. It was still hurting the day before the race, but I could at least run, and it was my last target last race after all.</span></p>\r\n<p ><span>Next day, race day: cold and windy. I warmed up wearing gloves and threatened to wear them for the race, until Nigel Herron counter-threatened to have me thrown out of the club for doing so. They went in with the bag drop, then we lined up and were soon off and running.</span></p>\r\n<p ><span>It was fast and warm to the turn, and with that tailwind I was well up on target average, finding myself pushing the pace with a group of similar paced runners. Into the headwind, and we were sharing the work well, constantly passing runners. No pain whatsoever form the ankle - race adrenaline is an amazing thing. Over the slight incline past the pier I spotted Jonny McCormack in a small group ahead. At about 2k to go and the leaders came back towards us &ndash; proud to see four Phoenix elites at the front of the race, with Ross Skelton running in second and Ian Leitch and Archie Davis battling for podium, chased by Max Dumbrell. Running hard into the turn, I needed a breather, but an Uckfield runner (ed: Jamie Keddie) accelerated and I welcomed the encouragement from my m, Tom Clewley, shouted as he headed towards the turn himself. The Uckfield guy was on it, and dragged us past Jonny&rsquo;s group before the race to the line. With my eyes fixed on the clock, I could see I&rsquo;d done it: sub 36. My official chip time was 35:40, for 77</span><span>th</span><span> place. A 10k pb for my comeback era (my actual 10k pb was set 1985 and yeah, k, that&rsquo;s before the internet existed).</span></p>\r\n<p ><span>Some great Phoenix results: Ross 2</span><span>nd</span><span> in 30:44, Ian 5</span><span>th</span><span> (and 1</span><span>st</span><span> M40) in 30:50, Archie 6</span><span>th</span><span> in 30:54 and Max 8th in 31:30. Big shout for Beth K, 1</span><span>st</span><span> Woman in 34:30. Wow!! And for all 22 Phoenix finishers, including my wife Taff, who finished in a creditable 1079</span><span>th</span><span>, 70</span><span>th</span><span> W45 but a little bit outs.</span></p>\r\n<p ><span>No more target races for me this year (yay!), just cross country (never mind!).</span></p>\r\n<p ><span><em>Thanks to Steve Atkinson for the report!</em></span></p>\r\n<p ></p>\r\n<p ><span><em>Thanks to Josh for the photos. The yellow and blue vests are Sussex team as sported by Beth and Archie<br /></em></span></p>",

It was time to put myself into a race.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>On the day the weather was reasonably good, the rain managed to hold off, until the evening, when it came pouring down. It was great to be on the start line surrounded by so many Phoenix athletes (39 in total I believe).</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As soon as the gun went off, I got myself positioned onto the back of the top group straight away, although, slightly holding back as I d&rsquo;t want to go off too hard. Not being a fan of cross country, I found this a pretty challenging course, with long uphill drags mixed with a hard downhill. I still don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get used to Stanmer&rsquo;s hills. Even with it being a home course, put together with the number of times I&rsquo;ve trained there, the hills proved to be a bit of a grit and grind to get myself up to the top, followed by watching my own steps with the underfoot being very uneven going downhill.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Overall, a great day for my first cross of the season, and for the Phoenix team. With noticeable results from all, with 6 of athletes packed into the top 15, Ian Leitch 5</span><span>th</span><span>, Robbie Fitzgibbon 6</span><span>th</span><span>, Max Dumbrell 8</span><span>th</span><span>, Myself 12</span><span>th</span><span>, Todd Leckie 13</span><span>th</span><span> and Spencer Thomas 15</span><span>th</span><span>.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>One final thing to mention is the amount of Phoenix athletes and supporters that were present.

It is great way of cross training that pushes you whilst allowing you to work at your own ability.</p>\r\n<p>The Phoenix sessions are on Monday evenings in school term timeat Downs Infants School on Ditchling Road, Brighton, BN1 6JA. Session is 19:00-20:00 hours but please try to arrive at 18:45 to set up promptly.<br />If you have a turbo trainer please bring it plus your bike of course. If you don't have a turbo please let Liz Hall. You will need to have your own turbo friendly rear skewer.</p>\r\n<p>Sessions will run from 5 November 2018 until 25 March 2019 except for School hol. So our last session before Christmas is on 17 December and then we start back on 7 January 2019.</p>\r\n<p></p>",

Our sole V40 rep Alex Bonzi was 32nd overall and 14th V40 in 35:59. Our V50 team (depleted by an unlucky spate of injuries andlast minute withdrawals) was a man short but Nigel Herron was 81st overall and 30th V50 in a time of 38:14, and Phil Grabsky 141st (27th V55) in 41:11. We da full V60 Team (though an aged one consisting of one V65 and two V70s!). Paul Whelpton was 89th in 38:16 and 2nd V65, just 16 seconds behind the V65 winner his old East London rival Dave Cox. Malcolm Kemp was 189th in 44:29 and 18th V65 (though unofficially we made him 1st V70). Andrew Haig was 193rd and 20th V65 (unofficially 3rd V70) in a time of 45:04.<br /><br />In the overall (ie V40 and above team competition Phoenix&rsquo;s first 3 finishers (Nigel Paul and Phil with an average age of 58) finished in a commendable 19th out of 27 teams.<br />In the V60 and above category Paul Malcolm and Andrew (average age 70) produced another impressive result to finish 5th out of 9 teams<br /><br /><strong>Inter-Counties</strong><br />In the Intercounties Match our Sussex reps were Jaymes Fonteyn 111th (12:47) in the U13 boys, Ben Connolly who was 88th in the U15 Boys (15:18), Maia Hardman (27th (19:22) and Milly Dickinson 57th (20:27 ) in U17 Girls and Naomi Fonteyn who was 15th (25:00) in the U20 Women&rsquo;s race. <br /><br /><strong>And the Protest?</strong><br />For the first time in many years the SEAA committee dec.

This medal haul places Phoenix second in the league. As this is an indiv, with every runner contributing at every race. But don&rsquo;t just take my word it.....</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is not a very cons. I really love the SGP and while I have missed running more this year the ones I have done I have really enjoyed. The country lanes of Horsham and Heathfield are a treat and I thoroughly enjoy the massed ranks of the Phoenix team plus my own indiv's fun &amp; satisfying. Perhaps my favourite this year has been Horsham as my daughter Ella ran so well and for me the Lewes Downland which is such a great route and race - with plenty of pacing issues and varied terrain to navigate - and I got up that big hill for the first time without stopping (though walked it just as quickly behind me!)... Just as much fun is pouring over Paul Whelpton's stats which he sends out so quickly after the race...&rdquo; <em>Phil Grabsky</em></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;For me the camaraderie , the team spirit and that it&rsquo;s really sociable - plus who can resist Pauls infectious enthusiasm !! Bewl 15 is my favourite race: Beautiful, bagpipes and beer afterwards - what&rsquo;s not to love!!&rdquo; <em>Amelie Culshaw</em></p>\r\n<p><span>&ldquo;Well not sure I&rsquo;ve made a very good go of doing it this year compared to last year. I loved the ability to contribute to the team effort despite being one of the slowest runners in the club. This in turn really helped me feel I was a legitimate club member and I enjoyed the camaraderie, the spirit of competition and got to know my club mates that bit more. Sadly I don&rsquo;t seem to have maintained the momentum this year. Could do better!</span>Favourite race: &ldquo;Any where the weather is pleasant and I manage to survive.I clearly need a bit of coaxing and encouragement. That and a bit more training might help. Paul&rsquo;s prompt crunching of the numbers is inspirational.&rdquo;<span >Jude Mathews</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&ldquo;Ok, so I haven&rsquo;t done it this year but this is why I d.</span>When I joined the Club in 2003 the then chairperson told me to do these races. They are quality events, local and varied and prov. Lewes 10 mile is my favourite because I like the distance and prefer a challenging off-road terrain. The series can prov.&rdquo;<span >LizHall</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&ldquo;I do SGP because it's a great way to get to know everyone within Phoenix as well as keep up my running and motivation when I know there's always a race coming up. It's also nice to know that even if I'm not the fastest my points still contribute!</span>My favourite race is the Hastings Half. There's always amazing crowd support and I enjoy the route even if it's hilly!&rdquo;<span >Hannah Felton</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&ldquo;I like the variety of the SGP races as it offers a real test of a runner's range and ability to adapt - from speedy 5 miles along Hasting Prom to the 15 mile undulating trail running of Bewl. I think the series could go further and have a 5k and/or even a proper XC race to really mix it up, but that would be being picky!</span>I also enjoy the season long battles you get with the same competitors (whether they're from other clubs or your PHX team mates) Last but not least it offers a great opportunity to meet and stay in touch with other PHX runners that are outs. Really important for club! Favourite race has to be Bewl 15 for its scenery and trails but I really enjoyed Heathfield 10k for the fact it was hard descent for first 5k followed by a brutal ascent for the second 5k which really splits the field.&rdquo;<span >Ash Dorrington</span></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This was the first year that I've taken part in the SGP, mainly inspired by Paul Whelpton's brilliant emails from last year. It's been a fun experience, I definitely plan to do it again next year. My favourite race: difficult to choose. Bewl was beautiful but brutal, Lewes 10 had stunning scenery throughout, Horsham and Heathfield were good days out too. The Phoenix 10k was a fun evening with a huge turnout, coinc(pity about the result). The best bit about taking part has been the camaraderie, regardless of how fast or slow you are everyone is treated the same, part of the team. We've been one of the biggest clubs at most of the races I've attended, I think because everyone is so welcoming and friendly.&rdquo;<span >Pete Goodman</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&ldquo;Things I love about the Sussex Grand Prix: being part of a Phoenix team that includes both men and women and a big mix of ages and abilities; the range of races of varying distances and terrain; the banter (and of course the competition) with the familiar rivals from other clubs that you come up against regularly. Hard to pick one favourite race as it's the variety that I like, but Heathfield 10k has a r.</span>I would like to see all the local clubs,and more elite runners, participating fully in the SGP, and we are doing our best to help bring in changes that will make it an even better and more inclusive competition.&rdquo;<span >Paul Whelpton</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&ldquo;As a newcomer to Phoenix, joining in the summer, the Sussex Grand Prix immediately appealed to me. Like many runners I enjoy analysing my past performances and those of fellow runners so the SGP has brought that to a new level for me as I can see the cumulative performance throughout the year for myself, friends and that of Phoenix overall. It is also great to be able to contribute to the overall success of Phoenix without having to be among the best in the club.</span>I have only made it to 2 races due to my late start this year but of those my favourite was the Lewes 10M. A tough but stunning run on the Downs, it was great to be welcomed in by the faster Phoenix runners gathered at the finish.&rdquo;<span >Tony Rickwood</span></p>\r\n<p>If you would like to contribute in this year&rsquo;s races, check out the website below for further info, book out as many dates as you can when they are announced &amp; get yourself on the group Phoenix e-mail group:</p>\r\n<p><span><a href=\"http://sussexgrandprix.co.uk/news/\">http://sussexgrandprix.co.uk/news/</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span>brightonphoenix@gmail.com</span></p>\r\n<p><span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Twenty seven Phoenix athletes ran the first of whom twenty one jogged up the hill to Hove Park for the second with 29 from Phoenix running there. Rumour has it that a few of the vets stopped off for a pint in between. The media team couldn't possibly comment!<br /><br />You'd have thought that this would be just a fun outing but there were some stunning performances. <strong>Alex Bonzi</strong>, <strong>Cyril Crua</strong>, <strong>Ollie Akesson</strong>, <strong>Phil Grabsky</strong> and <strong>Madelaine Parmar</strong> all ran PBs as d<strong>Todd Leckie</strong> who used the occasion to knock an astonishing 23 seconds off his previous best, winning in 15:46. Doubtless they'd all been tucked up in bed by 9pm the night before!<br /><br />On to Hove Park where <strong>Todd</strong> repeated the performance, winning in 16:01 and knocking 22 seconds off his previous best. <strong>Ollie Akesson</strong> ran his second PB of the day and <strong>Pete Goodman</strong> also ran a PB unfazed by his earlier effort at Hove Prom.<br /><br />The overall numbers were astounding with 787 running on the Prom and 826 at Hove Park. Both venues struggled to get finishers processed but it was a sensational experience.<br /><br />Let's all do it again next year.</p>\r\n<p><em>Photo: Josh Guilmant</em></p>",

The course got some favourable reviews from those who ran:</p>\r\n<p>\"I personally much preferred the course at Coombes Farm and this is from an out and out road runner! It started with a challenging hill which eventually flattened out and lead to a fantastic trot across the downs. Once the initial hill was over the course was gently undulating and was very run-able. The long downhill at the end of the lap was much needed and very enjoyable.\" Erica M</p>\r\n<p>\"Sweeping grass hills with great open views. Some taxing climbs then ending in a swooping valley bottom downhill run with the finish long in view. Rather spectacular.\" Andrew H</p>\r\n<p>\"Nice to be out in country rather than in a park and had Lovely open views over the downs (obviously only noticed whilst warming up) and certainly d't miss that long track up hill in Lancing!!\" Amelia C</p>\r\n<p><span>\"I noticed the first letters of the surnames of our 7-strong male V50 team spelt out the words TWAS GBH. But it wasn't really that bad! Admittedly the day was on the cold and windy s, hilly but plenty of grass and relatively few overly muddy or stony bits. Good for spectators too, a 2-lap course with start and finish in a hollow so you could watch the runners climb up out of it at the start of each lap, travel along the r(great views for the runners there if they had the energy to look around) and then race down a grassy slope to the finishing line.\" Paul W</span></p>\r\n<div>Well done to Paul Whelpton &amp; Erica Martin - 3rd M60 &amp; M35, and to our M60 (actually 60/70!) men who won silver, and our M40 men who ran phenomenally well to hold off a strong challenge from Brighton &amp; Hove and retain the team title.</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>",

Paul Weir broke 35 mnutes for the first time whilst Paul Whelpton gave another indication of his misspent youth (and m) by posting his fastest time for over 30 years.Others to claim pbs were Ash Dorrington, Phil Hampshire, Steve Atkinson, Phil Grabsky, Malcolm Kemp and Cat Bounds. The huge number of pbs set overall in the race might raise questions over the course measurement, though it is more likely that the perfect sunny, cool and exceptionally windless conditions were the key factor. The male and female course records were both broken and the first seven finishers all ducked under the 30-minute barrier.</span></p>\r\n<p><span></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span>There were Sussex Championship medals at stake and we claimed four of them &ndash; silvers in V50-59, V60-69 and V70 for Steve Atkinson, Phil Hampshire and Malcolm Kemp respectively, andV60-69 gold for Paul Whelpton. The field was exceptionally high quality across all age groups, with runners from far afield attracted by the race&rsquo;s status as a qualifier for the England team for the Age Group International due to take place inBirmingham thisMay.At the time of writing it looks as though Paul Whelpton, who finished as 2</span><span><sup>nd</sup></span><span>V65 to guarantee his selection, may be our only representative there this year. Highlight of the day though has to be the welcome return to action of Bob Novis after his long period of recovery from serious injury.</span></p>",

The team out included overall indiv, Hannah Felton, Paul Wishart (who came on his bike!), Phil Grabsky picking up awards for himself and daughter Ella, Sarah Russell doing the same for herself and son Will, Malcolm and Andrew our fabulous double act who battled it out to the end as rivals for the V7 title, and Lance who despite hobbling d. But a special thankyou goes to Steve Selby who made it there despite having to head straight off to the airport afterwards, and must have clocked up another 10k getting up every 5 minutes to run to the stage to pick up both his awards and those for everyone else who wasn't there.<br />As well as picking up runners-up awards in both team competitions (reclaiming the title is our goal for 2019!) we took both the Men's and Women's indiv, with top-20 Finisher medals also going to Gill Checkley (13th), Matt Greenall (6th), Sean Butchers (7th), Tom Hooper (9th), Paul Wishart (11th), Paul Whelpton (14th) and Will Russell (18th). Amelia and Will also picked up the Ron Grover awards thanks to the number of races they clocked up. And we had two hat tricks in the Age Category awards with Ella Grabsky, Charlotte Matthews and Connie Jankowski finishing as 1st, 2nd and 3rd Junior Women, and Paul Wishart, Lance Bellers and Phil Grabsky repeating the feat in the V3 Men. The rest of our Age Category medal winners were Caz (3rd V1), Amelia (1st V2), Ash (1st Senior), Matt (2nd V1), Steve Selby (2nd V2), Paul Whelpton (1st V6), Malcolm and Andrew (1st and 2nd V7).</p>",
